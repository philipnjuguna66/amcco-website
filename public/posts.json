After which, you will be required to enter the title number and fill out the online land search form, which you will later submit.</p> <p>You will be required to pay the $500 amount that&#8217;s charged using the available payment methods. After making the payments, you can proceed to print the results or view them on your portal anytime you log in.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Contracting</h3> </li> </ul> <p>After conducting the search and the results turning out to be favorable, the purchaser shall request the vendor issue them with a letter of offer as well as the Agreement for Sale.</p> <p>These documents describe the terms of the Sale and Purchase that have been prepared by the vendor&#8217;s Advocate.</p> <p>Also, Both parties are encouraged to participate in the negotiation of terms such as payment and the period of completion of the transaction.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is important to note that a duly signed and attested Agreement for Sale sets out the relationship between the Purchaser and Vendor. If the Agreement for sale is not fully signed or the signatures are not witnessed, neither party has the right to enforce the terms of sale.</p> <p>And when it comes to agreeing on the price, the buyer works hand in hand with their advocates, who then prepare a letter of offer or intent showing the details of what the seller and purchaser agreed on, the description of the property on offer, and the proposed purchase price, all of which will also show modes of payment.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Sale Agreement</h3> </li> </ul> <p>The moment both the buyer and the seller agree on a common figure, then comes the closing deal, which is depositing payments. This is usually drafted by the seller’s advocate and presented to the buyer’s advocate for approval.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This is done to ensure that everything is done to the letter.</p> <p>Upon the execution of the sales agreement, the agreed deposit is paid by the purchaser through their advocate to the seller’s advocate’s account. So basically, the advocates are heavily involved in the whole process.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Clearing Land rates</h3> </li> </ul> <p>For starters, these are levies imposed on all parcels of land, and they are payable to the county governments.</p> <p>After the full payment of all rates is done, a clearance certificate is issued, which acts as evidence that all rates are due and interest accrued has been fully paid.</p> <p>A land rent clearance Certificate from the commissioner of Lands is also supposed to be acquired.</p> <p>Upon payment of any outstanding Land rent, if there is any, the commissioner of lands issues a Land rent clearance certificate.</p> <ul> <li> <h3><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/truth-about-title-deeds-in-kenya-part-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transfer Of Documents</a></h3> </li> </ul> <p>Immediately after the Purchaser and the seller have finished executing the payment process, they move on to the next stage, which is the transfer of documents to the buyer.</p> <p>The seller has the responsibility of ensuring that all the documents needed for the successful registration of the transfer of the title in favor of the purchaser are available.</p> <p>And this can only be done when the commissioner of lands has issued a green light over the same; until then, they wait.</p> <p>Also, in order for that process to go smoothly without shortcomings, the following ought to be availed of:</p> <p>An original title deed for the Property of Interest.<br /> Fully signed and filled transfer forms<br /> The lessors consent to the transfer.<br /> A valid Valuation report for the property</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Land Valuation</h3> </li> </ul> <p>The Valuation Department is one of the technical departments within the Ministry of Physical Planning. It is headed by the director of Land Valuation.</p> <p>The value is determined by comparing recent sales prices in the area with similar features, age, and condition as your property and then adjusting to reflect any differences between properties that might impact the sale price.</p> <p>The payable duty is determined by a government valuer, and the valuation is done to determine the true value of the land on the open market as of the date of transfer.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Valuation Of Stamp Duty</h3> </li> </ul> <p>This tax is levied on property leases at varying rates, depending on the lease duration. The Purchaser has the responsibility of paying the <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/what-to-know-about-land-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stamp duty tax</a> that&#8217;s usually determined by the</p> ",

it is actually in the culture that a man should have land rather than owning big German machines.</p> <p>You are respected by not just elders but by everyone because you have accumulated wealth that will multiply.</p> <ul> <li> <h3><strong>Land has No limitations</strong></h3> </li> </ul> <p>Land is an open project that isn&#8217;t limitative, as you are free to do anything you want with it, unlike other investments that can&#8217;t allow you to expand and do other things on the place that you have invested in.</p> <p>Land has quite a ton of things that you can do with it; it can work with agribusiness, Real estate, building a stadium, and other facilities that will generate income for you.</p> <p><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-genesis-v-annex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-3670 alignleft" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/110-meters.jpg" alt="amcco land" width="294" height="294" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/110-meters.jpg 1080w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/110-meters-300x300.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/110-meters-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/110-meters-150x150.jpg 150w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/110-meters-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a>In other words, on that piece of land, you can have more than six projects running at the same time.</p> <p>And in investment, every investor would want to create a lot out of one.</p> <p>If You are looking for land sellers, then look no further, as you have arrived at your destination.

There are different types of property deeds; you can use either the quitclaim deed or the grant deed.

Land contracts are advantageous to both the buyer and the seller.</p> <p>For the buyer, it provides an option to purchase real estate when they do not have good credit or if they’re not able to obtain approval for a mortgage for some other reason.</p> <p>Digitization of the land registry could potentially increase the volume of registered land transactions, reduce the level of informality, and thus improve registry comprehensiveness.<br /> Its Tax is payable within 30 days in order to avoid interest and penalties. The land transaction tax is a self-assessed tax. It is paid by the buyer of the land to the government.</p> <p>Read: <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/difference-between-land-rent-land-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAND RENT &amp; LAND RATE</a></p> ",

instead, it is calculated differently than ordinary property taxes.</p> <p>They are assessed at a rate based on the characteristics of a parcel or unit of property, which is the standard.</p> <p>The amount owners owe in property tax is determined by multiplying the property tax rate by the current market value of the land in question.</p> <p>For Instance, a parcel may be taxed based on square footage, by dwelling unit, or by imposing a flat rate on each parcel.</p> <p>The parcel tax helps provide a stable source of funding for schools and other public services that are not funded by other sources.</p> <ul> <li> <h3><strong>Property Transfer Tax</strong></h3> </li> </ul> <p>This is a one-time tax, or, in other words, a fee imposed by a state or local jurisdiction upon the transfer of real property from the seller to the buyer.</p> <p>The tax is usually based on the price or fair market value of the property.<br /> The location of the property is what determines who will be eligible to pay for it.<br /> The tax is calculated as a percentage of the sale price or the appraised value of the property.</p> <p>The percentage will vary depending on the city&#8217;s location or county.</p> <p>To estimate how much you owe in transfer tax, you simply need to multiply your transfer tax rate by your sale price.</p> <p>The transfer tax is a charge levied on the transfer of ownership or title to property from one individual or entity to another.</p> <p>A transfer tax is usually imposed by a state.<br /> The essence of this tax is to complete the sale of property from one owner to another.</p> <ul> <li> <h3><strong>Property-related fees</strong></h3> </li> </ul> <p>This is another special tax imposed on a parcel or a person.</p> <p>They are fees charged for specific services or benefits provided to property owners, such as water, sewer, and even garbage collection.<br /> This is a source for municipal bodies that provide important services like cleanliness, water supply, and other civic facilities.<br /> It is deducted from income tax for rental property owners, who can claim expenses such as operating costs and depreciation, among many others.<br /> These fees are beneficial for homeowners as they help maintain the value of the property and provide essential services to the people residing in that area, making their lives conducive and comfortable.</p> <p>Read: <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/how-to-identify-land-scammers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8 CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES</a></p> </div> ",

Tectonic earthquakes are caused when the crust becomes subjected to strain and eventually starts moving, hence causing the whole tragic incident.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Induced Forces</h3> </li> </ul> <p>These are basically human-based activities that are made by man, thus the tunnel and other numerous fracking projects. By building up such projects, they expose the land to its breaking point, which makes any small force, like a tsunami or wind blowing, lead to an earthquake.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Volcano Activity</h3> </li> </ul> <p>These are processes that are related to the volcano; they are very powerful as they are normally felt in the vicinity of the hypocentre. They are triggered when there is an explosion from an explosive volcano. It depends on the volcano.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Collapse Scenarios</h3> </li> </ul> <p>These situations can be triggered by natural phenomena as well, such as cave-ins and other areas that are close to the mining areas.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Seismic Waves</h3> </li> </ul> <p>These are situations caused by the sudden movement of materials within the earth, such as slipping along a fault during an earthquake. They are usually generated by explosions or landslides. However, surface waves consist of several major types and are known as long waves. These waves then cause heavy disruption when they flow as they are affected by changes in density.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Compression of the earth&#8217;s crust</h3> </li> </ul> <p>Pushing the earth&#8217;s crust together via compression forces will lead to it experiencing folding and faulting processes; this happens by squeezing rocks that cause them to fold and fracture. You can always tell the size or magnitude of earthquakes by measuring the actual amplitude of the seismic waves, which get recorded on a seismograph. Also, anything that will tend to destroy the perfect equilibrium or balance of the globe will likely cause an earthquake.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Large Bodies of Water (Dams)</h3> </li> </ul> <p>Just the rupture in the million tons of water would have hastened the earth’s shaking. No geological process can actually come up with such a huge concentration of mass in such a small area, except for a volcano.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Ground Water Extraction</h3> </li> </ul> <p>Just the process of digging a borehole to gain access to water leads to earthquakes because what that does is destabilize the fault.</p> <p>Read: <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/8-effects-of-deforestation-on-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8 EFFECTS OF DEFORESTATION ON LAND</a></p> </div> ",

Soils with good structure allow fast and thorough absorption of water.</p> <p>It is then that some of this water is readily taken by crops, while the additional water is retained deeper in pores to be drawn by plants during a drier season.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Protects the Soil from being Washed Away</h3> </li> </ul> <p>Soil erosion is basically removal of the top soil that actually causes many problems in modern agriculture.</p> <p>Crop rotation helps the top soil from being swept away as they act as cover crops holding the soil in place and minimize its direct exposure to extreme sunlight rain and wind.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>It becomes easier to control pest, weed control</h3> </li> </ul> <p>Crop rotation that entails changing the type of crop that you grow there on each season will help you. Rotation of crops can prevent an outbreak of pests or diseases. This method has proved to being effective because the pests can&#8217;t stay on that land for long as they thought they would.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Reduced Soil Compaction</h3> </li> </ul> <p>Cultivating the same crop for a long time brings about a likelihood that heavy machinery leads to soil compaction. By practicing crop rotation, we can help alleviate this issue, making it easier for air, water, and roots to penetrate the soil.</p> <p>READ: <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/8-effects-of-deforestation-on-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8 EFFECTS OF DEFORESTATION ON LAND</a></p> </div> ",

No extra effort is required to protect it or renovate it like you do to a building.</div> <div>There’s literally nothing to ‘do’. Land in its natural state will always be worth something!<br /> Land can stand for almost 30+ years and be in good form.</div> <div></div> <ul> <li> <h3>Land is a Tangible Resource</h3> </li> </ul> <div>You can always bet it with your life that land will always be in existence and will not vanish just like stocks do.<br /> Land can never depreciate unlike a product, one thing you should know about land is that as time goes by, the more value it gets and the price increases.</div> <div>Land will always be something physical and tangible that you own, regardless of the current economic situation.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Land is affordable</h3> </li> </ul> <div>Land is inexpensive to own over time. It has very little needs or care that needs to be attended to.<br /> All you need to do is pay property tax, that I had before told you why it is important in doing so.</div> <div>It is advisable that you own one because even this property taxes are just peanuts you give out very little money that will in turn do a lot on your land including safeguarding your identity as the owner and mind you land always appreciates value over time and so it&#8217;s a win situation here for you.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Land Increases Value Over Time</h3> </li> </ul> <div>Acquiring land in a less rural area far off from urban is usually cheap and price friendly because there aren&#8217;t many buildings set up but trust me with time the value does increase.<br /> And the question is who will be benefiting out of this? It&#8217;s probably you, the earlier you buy land the better because lately land is really going and the more you postpone this the more it might end up being hard for you to own land that you can start reaping the fruits later on in the future when value has increased.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Land is Easy to Acquire</h3> </li> </ul> <div>When owning a piece of land, you don&#8217;t necessarily rely on bank loans or group funds to do so because it&#8217;s an easy process.</div> <div>Most of the time, if it’s a private sale, you don’t even need to get a credit checks.</div> <div>Lately there are even options of buying with installments, things made easier for you, why not go for it?<br /> And you always have an option to pay cash for land.</div> <div>Land is very easy to purchase, and for the most part, you can buy when and wherever you feel like.</div> <div><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3356" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NEW-PROJ.jpg" alt="5 REASONS LAND FENCES ARE IMPORTANT" width="1280" height="143" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NEW-PROJ.jpg 1280w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NEW-PROJ-300x34.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NEW-PROJ-1024x114.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NEW-PROJ-768x86.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></div> <ul> <li> <h3>Land is Generally Available to all</h3> </li> </ul> <div>Many landowners are in for the deal.</div> <div>Usually people get land, and they end up selling it again probably maybe, we are just saying maybe, they had big plans for it and ended up not doing them because of their own reasons that they know, or they were maybe traumatized or some are just interested in getting money considering the high cost of living.<br /> Or perhaps the owner lives up country or abroad, and they don&#8217;t really need the land much.</div> <div>All these are lifetime opportunities that you can&#8217;t afford to turn a bind eye and, seize the moment and start making your dreams come true.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Great Source for Passive Income</h3> </li> </ul> <div>This entails regular earnings from a source other than an employer or contractor, and in this case it is another source which is now land. This is money earned in the background of your other revenue streams.<br /> There are many ways you can go about it too.</div> <div>Traditionally, you can buy land and let it appreciate to earn money without having to do anything at all.<br /> Alternatively, vacant land could be used for something else that will generate you money.</div> <div>Whether you rent the raw land to other businesses or create a tourist attraction on your land, the opportunities to leverage land investments are plentiful.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Land Gives You Freedom</h3> </li> </ul> <div>With having your own piece, you get to decide on how you want it to look like and more importantly, what projects you want to start.<br /> You can literally put anything up that you&#8217;ve always wanted, even the big buildings and malls that you see in films, you call the shots here now.Investing in land has no specific kind of people, it is an opportunity for everyone looking to outgrow themselves and build or add onto their career.

If someone else controls mineral and logging rights on the land, you may face significant delays to completing any construction you had planned on or may have a rude awakening one morning.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>You Cant Access Your Own Place</h3> </li> </ul> <div>It happens in quite a number of incidents where you just bought a piece of land believing you could use the nearby driveway after all, the seller drove you in on it right?. But now it seems you have no right to use it. The driveway is not on your land it&#8217;s someone&#8217;s else and you know how people hate trespassing.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Confirm access before buying as well</h3> </li> </ul> <div>Again, make sure your attorney reviews a current survey that confirms your access to a public road. Or, if the property relies on easements across neighbouring land, then make sure you and your attorney review those documents to ensure that you have all the access you need.</p> <p>Seriously you can&#8217;t buy a property where the only way you can access it is through a flight or an helicopter!</p></div> <ul> <li> <h3>Talk to Neighbors</h3> </li> </ul> <div>Yeah very very important! I get it you are antisocial and all that you just wanna live your life and that&#8217;s okay but what about asking the neighbors about the land.<br /> They are definitely going to know all the land background they have all the details that will help you settle in. matter fact they are people who will help you in the wrong run.</p> <p>Don&#8217;t assume just say hi and ask one or two things.</p> <p>Following the above tips for avoiding land buying nightmares will help make your land more pleasant and smooth process that will help you ensure that you will be able to enjoy the land and your new home the way you’ve dreamed it to be.</p> <div class="yj6qo"></div> </div> <div></div> <div>Read: <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/the-dos-and-donts-of-buying-a-vacant-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 DO’S AND DONT’S OF BUYING A VACANT LAND</a></div> ",

where the deceased leaves behind a valid will declaring his or her intentions or wishes regarding the disposition of his property after his death in accordance with the law of succession Act.<br /> Here the property of the deceased is given out as per the terms of the will.</div> <div>(A will is a statement left by the deceased person sharing their wishes and interest on how they would want their property to be divided or distributed it also has the name of the person whom has been chose an the successor)</div> <div>All this arrangements are made before the person passes.<br /> The will always has no power thus any legal effects until the day the person who wrote it passes.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Intestate Succession</h3> </li> </ul> <div>This is situation is whereby a person dies without having made a will or the will is invalidated.<br /> Although the law of succession act makes provision for both monogamous and polygamous situations.</div> <div>And in this case according to law family members are given first priority to inherit the estate.</div> <div><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"

are no spouses, then the property is given to the children.<br /> Of course if there are no children or spouses left then the property is given to family members if there were any, and if it again

broad conversation with them on how that can be worked out, it basically entails talking it through in a more polite reasonable way.</div> <div>The main aim of this is to give each party a chance to air out their views so that the problem can be identified and more easier ways will be looked for so that they can resolve the matter.</div> <div>And in this case it&#8217;s always advisable to ensure

consider raising the stakes as well as this can be done by involving respected, high ranked leaders may be able to use their authority to help both parties resolve difficult land conflicts.<br /> Some people are always threatened when they see high office officials because that, to them is power and authority at work and they will kneel to them rather than using village elders other people need to be shaken a little bit and this only applies if the above one has failed.<br /> And finally once a resolution to the conflict is reached, it should be recorded in writing and signed by all the parties.</div> <div>This will help ensure that everyone adheres to the signed agreement.

LEASING LAND.</a></h2> <div>Having some background information about something is very wise and strategical as this will guide you into making the right decision.<br /> First we start with understanding the term lease:</div> <div>This is basically a legal, binding contract outlining the terms under which one party agrees to rent property owned by another party.</div> <div>It allows the tenant to use the property and guarantees the property owner or landlord regular payments for a specified period in exchange.</div> <div><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/categories-of-land-ownership-in-kenya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leasing land</a> in Kenya has become a norm lately because very many have started investing in their lands not necessarily meaning that they stay there but they buy land and setup business or lease it to someone for a given period of time it&#8217;s almost like renting.</div> <div>But their interest are always based on commercial interests.</div> <div>Below are 5 things that you should consider before striking a deal with someone or a company that wants to agree with you:</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Do Reece</h3> </li> </ul> <div>This means that you go in search of the particular land that you want get into that market and do your research depending on what you want to lease the land for.</div> <div>If it&#8217;s for agribusiness consider going deep in rural areas because there are large sections of land there at an affordable price plus an added advantage is that there you will get easily available labour.</div> <div>If it&#8217;s something to do with offices then get into those towns.</div> <div>After you have identified the why and the when (thus the period when you wish to commence operations and for how long you will be doing so).</div> <div>And once you find potential lessors, you will negotiate some basic terms (I hear people using the phrase “irreducible minimums”) before hashing out a final agreement.</div> <div>After you have identified the why and the when (thus the period when you wish to commence operations and for how long you will be doing so).</div> <div>And once you find potential lessors, you will negotiate some basic terms (I hear people using the phrase “irreducible minimums”) before hashing out a final agreement.<br /> Look into the newspapers, internet and other publications among many others.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Have a Visible Written Agreement</h3> </li> </ul> <div>This is a binding agreement between two or more people that is enforceable by law.</div> <div>It&#8217;s kind of a legal document summarizing an agreement between parties in a dispute to abide by the decision of an arbiter.</div> <div>And in this case, the preference for a written agreement would be helpful to ensure strict adherence to what was discussed and concluded by both parties when they were making a deal.</div> <div>It also favors one who is taking on the lease by ensuring that their rights are recognizable in defence against an owner who may seek to renege on your agreement.</div> <div>It&#8217;s always good to be on the on the safe legal side like what it?</div> <div>A written agreement also precludes messy oral arguments outside of what was agreed upon and recorded.</div> <div>The law only recognizes oral leases that do not exceed a two year, non-renewable term.</div> <div>The agreement will cover much wider terms other than price and duration to include issues such as assignment of responsibility for government levies maintenance, removals as well as any other responsibilities and even termination of the agreement.<br /> This very agreement helps parties to go over and beyond the implied rights.</div>

agreement.</div> <div>Then consider registering your lease agreement.</div> <div>A lease agreement registration also helps in protecting the rights of both parties.</div> <div>A landlord/lady is more comfortable giving his house to a renter if the lease agreement is legally and validly registered.</div> <div>Because it shows that it&#8217;s not fraud.<br /> For Instance, if a landowner is declared bankrupt or dies, a registered lease may serve the purpose of recognizing and protecting the rights of the lessee when a trustee to the bankrupt person or administrators to the estate of the deceased lessor are appointed.</div> <ul> <li> <h3>Do Some Research on the Area of Interest.</h3> </li> </ul> <div>If you&#8217;ve spotted a place that you desire to own then consider doing some bit of research about the area get to know how people operate and learn your environment well.<br /> It is basically cracking the three questions that are: Who, Where and What.<br /> Who in the sense that the one that offers you land, how well is he or she known have some background information about the person.</p> <p>Where: Here it&#8217;s all about knowing the location that you want to lease land like is that the place that&#8217;s convenient for you, for instance, is it on the mountain, landscape, nearness to the river such like and on.</p> <p>What: Here you get to answer the question what you want to set up on that particular land and the portion that you may have chosen already. Like If you may need it for commercial purposes or Agribusiness.</p></div> <ul> <li> <h3>Create an Exit Plan</h3> </li> </ul> <div>Nobody really thinks of this outset of a venture to having an exit strategy or to plan too far ahead of all the intricacies that must be worked out at the time of the lease agreement.</div> <div>However, for business reasons, it is advisable to have a clear understanding of the end goal from the start, so that you know what to do when maybe things don&#8217;t work out as you had planned.</div> <div>On the expiration of a lease agreement, one of the implied terms is that the lessee will hand over control of the land in the condition in which it was delivered to him by the lessor.</div> <div>This where contracts come in if at all you signed them then you are on the safe side, while this may be provided for in the registered lease agreement, it is important to think clearly and plan ahead for the exit, which may involve thinking about what happens to any renovations you may have made to the land while leasing it, as well as the costs associated with returning the land to the condition in which it was originally when it was handed to you.<br /> The exit plan provides a period immediately prior to disengagement with the lessor.</div> <div></div> <div>Read: <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/top-10-areas-to-buy-most-affordable-land-in-kenya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 10 Areas to Buy Most affordable land in Kenya</a></div> ",

That there is tech!</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Referring to Landmarks</h3> </li> </ul> <p>If your property is well-developed and has well known social amenities or already set up business centers, then consider using them.</p> <p>It would be easier that way because directing someone from a known business center will be easier and quick unlike doing so from a totally different unknown place.</p> <p>In addition to that, you can as well make use of the prestigious surroundings in your area having land that&#8217;s close to a much-needed area is always another hack to getting clients, for instance land that&#8217;s close to malls, market centers, filling stations, hospitals and even well known schools.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Refer to Proper Grammar When Doing So</h3> </li> </ul> <p>Understanding verbs and prepositions when directing is one of the things that will help you when it comes to communicating with your clients.</p> <p>The secret to cracking this strategy is using short, easily understandable and accurate phrases.</p> <p>Of course, we all understand that you are a pro when it comes to grammar but in this case, don&#8217;t out do yourself your clients don&#8217;t want to hear how much of a literature guy you are they want to understand how they can get that land and for the record not everybody even understands English a times you might be forced to switch to their local language or even Swahili so always be flexible and use simple language.</p> <p>Once you would have mastered how to communicate with your client, the rest will just be a walk in the park.</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Always offer Estimations When it Comes to Distance</h3> </li> </ul> <p>You are targeting people from all over the country if not all over the world then and of course not everybody knows that area well.</p> <p>It will be easier if you will offer them an estimate distance to your property from where they are so that they make calculations on how they will plan and be there.</p> <p>In addition, you can also advise them the shortest route that they might use which is not so bumpy and one that doesn&#8217;t have heavy traffic.</p> <p>Tell them how long it will take, offer the time and the distance that they will need to cover, send them figures.</p> <p>It&#8217;s always the first impressions, the way you handle your clients that go a long way, it&#8217;s how people end up getting referrals and even selling out because of how you treated them well.</p> </div> <div></div> <h2>CLASSIFICATIONS OF LAND AND WHAT THEY ENTAIL.</h2> <div><span style="color: #e8eaed;

target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Pricing</strong></a></h3> </li> </ul> <p class="p3">Generally, buying land in Kenya to build a house is cheaper than buying an already built house.</p> <p class="p3">However, this also depends on the location and size of the land and the type of house you want to build.</p> <p class="p3">Buying an already built house can be more expensive because the cost of the land, building materials, and labor has already been included in the price.</p> <ul> <li> <h3><b>Customization</b></h3> </li> </ul> <p class="p3">Buying land to build a house allows you to have more control over the design and construction of your home.</p> <p class="p3">You can customize the layout, size, and features of the house to meet your specific needs and preferences.</p> <p class="p3">When buying an already built house, you may have to adhere with the existing design and features, or pay extra to make changes.</p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li4"> <h3><b>Timeframe</b></h3> </li> </ul> <p class="p3">Building a house on your own land can take longer than buying an already built house.</p> <p class="p3">The construction process can take several months to a year, depending on the size and complexity of the house.</p> <p class="p3">On the other hand, buying an already built house can be a quicker process, and you can move in as soon as the transaction is complete.</p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li4"> <h3><b>Infrastructure</b></h3> </li> </ul> <p class="p3">When buying land to build a house, you may need to invest in infrastructure such as water, electricity, and roads.</p> <p class="p3">This can add to the overall cost and time required to complete the project.</p> <p class="p3">In contrast, buying an already built house usually means that the infrastructure is already in place.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2887 alignleft"

            "rendered": "<p>When it comes to buying land in Kikuyu within Nairobi Metropolis area, two names are popularly mentioned.<br /> <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/why-you-should-invest-in-kamangu-and-thigio-2023/">Kamangu and Thigio</a></em> have over the past semi decade been explored for their large parcels of affordable land suitable for residential or speculation purposes.</p> <p>These areas are developing at a fast pace due to the urbanization plans by the government and infrastructure improvement i.e. <em><a href="https://youtu.be/OHb1fRCtwZo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tarmacking of roads</a></em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On a daily basis, land investors opt to invest in this areas as a majority of other popular areas around Nairobi i.e. Juja, Ruiru, Kamulu etc. are being rapidly depleted whilst remaining portions sold expensively.</p> <p>Even though <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/why-you-should-invest-in-kamangu-and-thigio-2023/">Kamangu and Thigio</a> </em>are very prime and close to each other, they have differences in benefits when it comes to buying land in either.</p> <p>Therefore, in this blog we cover all benefits that <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/why-you-should-invest-in-kamangu-and-thigio-2023/">Thigio and Kamangu</a></em> bring on the table to compare which area is best value for your money.</p> <p>Remember when buying land, one investor&#8217;s preference is not another’s, therefore, distinguishing what benefits you will help you invest wisely.</p> <h2> <strong style="color: var( --e-global-color-primary ); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">1.Proximity to Nairobi CBD</strong></h2> <p>Kamangu borders Thigio and both are linked to and by <a href="https://youtu.be/Luf0V5ChZoQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dagoretti Road, which leads to the Southern Bypass</a>.</p> <p>Using either the Southern Bypass or Ondiri Road from Kamangu to Kikuyu, you can ply either Waiyaki Way, Ngong road or Langata road to access Nairobi CBD.</p> <p>Under minimal traffic, a smooth drive will take less than 35 mins guaranteeing you fast accessibility to Nairobi CBD and back to Kamangu or Thigio.</p> <p>The evident difference here is the 5 minutes extra time from Nairobi to Thigio than Kamangu. Honestly, this isn’t a deal breaker as most investors still choose Thigio for various advantages than Kamangu.</p> <p>The distance from kikuyu to kamangu is 8kms, While the distance from Thigio to Kikuyu is 11 Kms. The Distance from Nairobi to Kamangu is 35KMS and Distance from Nairobi to Thigio is 38 kms</p> <h2><strong>2.Accessibility (Road Networks)</strong></h2> <p>The Kenya Rural Roads Authority(KERRA) has delivered a couple or road networks within the larger Ndeiya and Kikuyu Area covering a vast of rural roads in <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/why-you-should-invest-in-kamangu-and-thigio-2023/">Thigio and Kamangu</a></em> respectively.</p> <p>Thigio tops with more number of the rural access roads being tarmacked than Kamangu. This includes the Ha Koinange &#8211; Gitutha Road off Dagoretti road that leads to our prime Thigio <strong><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/">plots for sale</a></strong>.</p> <p>Kamangu on the other hand has wider network of murram roads, however,  some have been commissioned for tarmacking soon.</p> <p>All the access roads from Kamangu and Thigio connect to Dagoretti Road which links to the Southern Bypass or Ondiri road opening access to areas outside Kikuyu.</p> <p>Overall experience in terms of tarmac roads, Thigio takes the lead but Kamangu is also promising  if and when an investor is ready to wait for tarmacking.</p> <h2><strong>3.Local Amenities</strong></h2> <p>Hospitals inclusive <strong>Oakwood Hospital, Lusigetti Sub County Hospital and Orthodox Medical Center</strong> serve the two localities equally.</p> <p>In matters education, Thigio has its own set of schools and similarly Kamangu. This does not mean children can&#8217;t study in either of the areas since it is a case of school preference mostly standard performance and general distance while commuting to and from home.</p> <p>Entertainment Joints such as Kamangu Gardens are located within Kamangu and Lusigetti, hence, residents of Thigio will often commute to these places for leisure.</p> <p>Thigio is nearer to <em><a href="https://www.limuruwater.go.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Limuru Water Company</a></em> than Kamangu but that isn&#8217;t a deal breaker as water is supplied fairly to residents within these two localities.</p> <p>Even though local amenites are plenty and available to serve these areas, preferences might kick in to visit Nairobi for a luxurious and city based entertainment life. It&#8217;s is upon you to decide whether or not to enjoy locally or travel  further for a different experience.</p> <h2><strong>4.Residential Vs. Speculation Suitability</strong></h2> <p>Due to the huge availability of land in Thigio and it&#8217;s overall sparse population, it&#8217;s more suitable and chosen by land investors for residential purposes.</p> <p><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-genesis-v-annex/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/336235471_1572415876568942_576534982045517996_n-min.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="448" /></a></p> <p>The wide variety of tarmac roads make transportation and commuting easier for residents to move in and out quickly without strains during dusty and muddy days.</p> <p>Kamangu is also a variable option for residential purposes due to its rapid urbanization within its  town.</p> <p>Although it stands a chance to house your dream home, more people will often choose it for <strong><em><a href="https://youtu.be/gPFocswx_wM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation</a></em></strong> as the ongoing tarmacking projects will derive high value to the lands once done.</p> <p>Therefore, plots bought today will be sold later at a 60%+ profit margin.</p> <p>That alone is a promising business venture for people hence the area widely chosen for <strong><em><a href="https://youtu.be/gPFocswx_wM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation purposes</a></em></strong> than Thigio.</p> <p>Once again it&#8217;s your choice to make based on your purchase needs. Some investors always opt for Thigio over Kamangu and vice versa for speculation or residential.</p> <h3><strong> </strong><strong>5.Land Value Additional </strong></h3> <p>Land in areas of Kikuyu and Ndeiya which inhabit both Kamangu and Thigio speculate at a margin of 60% per year.</p> <p>This <a href="https://youtu.be/DEr5YDDP5lA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>value addition</em></strong></a> rate is impressive and profitable for land selling business personnels. Investors are encouraged to purchase land based of positive attributes and this one falls as a sure guarantee.</p> <p>The fact that land is affordable in both <strong><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/why-you-should-invest-in-kamangu-and-thigio-2023/">Thigio and Kamangu</a></strong> makes these areas of interest to purchase and resell later. The only time breaker in your land&#8217;s <em><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/DEr5YDDP5lA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value addition</a></strong></em> is how well you maintain it as illustrated <strong><em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/5-ways-to-add-value-to-your-plot/">here.</a></em></strong></p> <p>Beware that land adding value at 60% isn&#8217;t automatic but rather a process that is spearheaded by looking after the land to ensure its in good condition and appealing to your next buyer.</p> <p><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/precious-gardens-plots-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3057 size-full" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prime-Plots-For-Sale.jpg" alt="Plots For Sale" width="1280" height="143" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prime-Plots-For-Sale.jpg 1280w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prime-Plots-For-Sale-300x34.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prime-Plots-For-Sale-1024x114.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prime-Plots-For-Sale-768x86.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></p> <p>That is a key factor to check on while owning land for speculation purposes.</p> <p>The commissioning of <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/ndeiya-is-officially-the-13th-subcounty-of-kiambu-county/"><strong>Thigio into Ndeiya&#8217;s Sub county</strong></a> headquarters has made it more interesting to investors willing to build rental units for high end clients.</p> <p>Tarmac roads is also a tie breaker between the value of land in <strong><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/why-you-should-invest-in-kamangu-and-thigio-2023/">Thigio and Kamangu.  </a></strong>The two factors combined have made land in Thigio more valuable than in Kamangu hence resulting to a surge in land prices in Thigio than Kamangu.</p> <p>However, this does not make a huge difference as most land prices in these areas are within notable price range. There are so many factors that differentiate in between these two areas but the above mentioned stand out more often.</p> <p>Therefore when scouting for land to purchase in the area, do put into consideration this and that so as to make the right decision.</p> <p>Seeing is believing, we welcome you for a <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/AhdS3tcuZj0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free site visit</a></strong> and have a look at our Kamangu and Thigio<strong><em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/"> plots for sale</a></em></strong> in Thigio or Kamangu at your convenience.</p> <p>Kamangu Plots for sale, <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/olive-gardens-phase-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olive Gardens Phase 1</a> and <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/olive-gardens-plots-for-sale/">Olive Gardens Phase 2</a></p> <p>Enquire for more via <strong>0701 293 199</strong> or email us at <strong>amccoproperties@gmail.com</strong>.</p> ",

The road was rough and dry full of dust on sunny days and mud on rainy days, causing havoc to all commuters using it.</p> <p>The access tarmac road brought new links to Dagoretti Road, Ondiri Road and the Southern Bypass super fast unlike before due to bad road conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most land selling areas within Nairobi aren&#8217;t even close to having a tarmac road as good and new as this one. The most impressive fact is that prices in this area are affordable despite the tarmac which would have turned out as a inflation bait.</p> <p><strong>Example; <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/genesis-gardens-phase-4-plots-for-sale/">Genesis Phase 4</a></strong> borders the tarmac road yet selling at <strong>1.2 million</strong> Kenyan shillings per plot compared to market prices of <strong>1.7-2.5 million</strong> Kenyan shillings for similar plots.</p> <h3><strong>2.Increased Investment Opportunities and High Value Addition Rate</strong></h3> <p>Several factories , farm yards and greenhouses have been set up along Ha Koinange &#8211; Gitutha Road and it&#8217;s environs due to the affordable cost of owning premises, land and also transportation using the tarmac to external areas.&nbsp;</p><p>A good example is a Chicken Farm House that is setup next to <strong><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/genesis-gardens-phase-4-plots-for-sale/">Genesis Phase 4</a></strong> by an investor rearing chicken to be sold in restaurants and hotels.</p> <p>&nbsp;The area has a favorable climate that supports farming maize, beans and green house crops like tomatoes and onions sold for grocery purposes.</p> <p>Farming has been an evident activity practiced by residents within Ndeiya inclusive Thigio.

            "rendered": "<p>Land prices are shooting high daily and the chances of owning land the more you procrastinate are reducing. The high land prices stand out as the most worrying factor to why most Kenyans haven’t invested in land yet.</p> <p>Securing a plot that will house your family or hold your business in the future is the one of the best investments you will ever make.</p> <p>Land, unlike other commodities only appreciates; meaning five years from now the land will be more valuable and can be sold to gain back profits.</p> <p><strong>Question: </strong><em>High land prices are alarming but should they stop you from investing for the future?</em><br /> The big answer is <strong>No</strong>.</p> <p>This is because <em>the more you wait the more land becomes expensive</em> but a decision made today will be value earned tomorrow.</p> <p>This means even despite the high land prices, there is always a solution to beat them and you can</p> <p>acquire land with whatever budget you have.</p> <h2>Investing in land as Chama</h2> <p>In 2023, we have made it easier and advantageous for couples and groups like chamas, saccos and merry go rounds to pool together funds and own a piece of land from our ongoing projects.</p> <p>In a previous blog, we explained on how a couple can combine effort to acquire land at affordable rates as illustrated <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/land-3-reasons-to-invest-as-a-couple/">in this blog.</a></p> <p>In this blog specifically we share information useful to groups that covers how they can own land today and beat the high market prices.</p> <p>Similar to the <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/best-financing-when-investing-in-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best financing options</a> article, we answer the following questions that might be holding you back from making a wise move;</p> <ol> <li><strong>Who’s name will be on the Title Deed?</strong></li> <li><strong>Who pays the land amount?</strong></li> <li><strong>Who gets to receive and store the Title Deed?</strong></li> <li><strong> Who will conduct the Site and Office Visits?</strong></li> </ol> <h2>Role Delegation in Chama`s</h2> <p>Every group has members allocated various roles that enable smooth operations within it. This applies even when a group decides to purchase land.</p> <p>The group should allocate individuals with roles like visiting and scouting the land, filling the forms, visiting the realtor’s office, delivering the payment etc.</p> <p>The members might also prefer to conduct the whole processes as a group for the sake of accountability and witnessing as things happen.</p> <p>It all depends on a particular group. So far we have interacted with numerous groups during site visits and most came as a full team to ensure everyone onboard saw and approved the land they were about to purchase.</p> <p>It is thereafter that representatives come to our office to proceed on with the remaining<br /> acquisition process including payment and filling transfer forms.</p> <h2>Land Search</h2> <p>In case there is a <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/how-to-conduct-a-land-search-in-kenya-2/"><em>land search</em></a> to be conducted, the representatives are also tasked with visiting and engaging the land registry to complete the process.</p> <p>Groups that have invested with us have cited this as the efficient way in their operations while purchasing the land on behalf of the whole group.</p> <h2><strong>Financing the Land Purchase</strong></h2> <p>A popular benefit in belonging to a group is the fact that you can achieve more with less considering you actively participate.</p> <p>Most groups operate by receiving contributions from members whereby the funds are used to acquire something that individuals wouldn’t have on their own.</p> <p>Land pricing is on the high end with prices ranging from 500,000 Kenyan shillings and above in developed areas like Kikuyu.</p> <p>Therefore individual members aiming to purchase land in the area but are constrained by their budgets can take advantage of their membership in a group.</p> <p>He/she can either <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/best-financing-when-investing-in-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquire a loan</a> to fund their purchase or rather invite the whole group into investing alongside.</p> <p>On the other end, groups are commonly associated with pooling resources together to fund one main purchase that will benefit the entire team.</p> <p>It is super important to join a group that aims to buy land if you want land rather than joining random groups that won’t align with your aim and vision.</p> <p>For land buyers with limited budgets, funding a land purchase is easier and way affordable done by a group considering all you contribute is a small portion of the total yet receive a significant share of the land purchased.</p> <p>The members will contribute based on the size of land they want to purchase and also discuss the member shares based on the same amount.</p> <p>Groups are also advantageous when it comes to receiving funds from banks and saccos for mega projects that an individual cannot afford to fund alone.</p> <p>Most groups will often buy large parcels of land and distribute significantly among members or alternatively <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/speculation-profit-in-real-estate/">retain the land for future resell</a></em> to gain profits back.</p> <p>It all depends with the aim of the group towards investing in land.</p> <p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@amccopropertiesltd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMCCO Properties Limited</a>, we accept purchases from groups and overtime we have nurtured a huge community of land buyers through group purchases.</p> <p>Hence, we continue to embrace groups interested in purchasing land within the Nairobi Metropolis Area and assure to deliver the best value at affordable prices.</p> <h2><strong>Title Deed Ownership</strong></h2> <p>The fact that land is bought by over 2 people in a group is worrying in terms of who’s name is written on the <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/truth-about-title-deeds-in-kenya-part-one/">Title Deed</a> on behalf of the rest.</p> <p>Good news is that this isn’t the case in 2023 as the land registry considers every member and has set aside solutions to eradicate future disputes when the <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/the-truth-about-title-deeds-part-2/">Title Deed</a> is issued.</p> <p>Title deeds are subdivided according to the land shares or rather registered under the whole legal group name.</p> <p>Even when members are huge in numbers to over 20 people, each will either receive an individual Title deed or still be named as an owner in the Mother Title Deed.</p> <p>It all depends on the size of land purchased and also agreement between the group members.</p> <p>More often huge parcels of land measured in acres are the ones subdivided to produce individual Title Deeds whilst the small plots are registered under the whole group since they can’t be subdivided further .</p> <h3>Title Deed Storage</h3> <p>The Title Deed storage is decided by the group members whereby it can be either in the bank, group headquarters or within a member’s custody.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, 2023 has more to offer to all land investment groups in Kenya looking forward to purchasing land in a well developed area within Nairobi Metropolis area.</p> <p>Therefore we invite all of your to our daily site visits from <strong>Monday to Sunday</strong> and get to

A good successful story is of Mark and Carol who purchased land and today are happy for their wise move; <a href="https://youtu.be/oBpOsatUlss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Here’s their full story.</em></a></p> <p>Their story is just one out of many with evidence that two are better than one when it comes to investing in land.</p> <p>In this blog, we explain further on how owning land as a couple with AMCCO is easier and more advantageous to you and your spouse than you could ever imagine.</p> <p>You will also learn all legal aspects and processes of land ownership that guarantee you equality when investing land with your spouse.</p> <h2><strong>Site and Office Visits</strong></h2> <p>It is important for each couple to discuss and decide on particular roles during their land ownership journey.</p> <p>The roles range from visiting the realtor’s office, visiting the land, conducting land searches and picking/dropping the documents from the realtor’s office etc.</p> <p>When such roles are performed as agreed upon then it is unlikely for spouses to cross paths during their investment journey.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-2646 " src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/331405081_1422190545278144_6691499299682999436_n.jpg" alt="amcco payment plans" width="436" height="436" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/331405081_1422190545278144_6691499299682999436_n.jpg 843w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/331405081_1422190545278144_6691499299682999436_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/331405081_1422190545278144_6691499299682999436_n-150x150.jpg 150w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/331405081_1422190545278144_6691499299682999436_n-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></p> <p>At times, one partner will be busy or rather not available to perform a task physically regarding their land acquisition process. Therefore it is important for the other partner to help accomplish the pending task beforehand.</p> <p>Alternatively, most spouses prefer to do these tasks together which is even better and satisfactory to both parties. Either way, as long as all the processes and steps are covered on time, owning their land will be so fast and swift.</p> <h2><strong>Financing the Land Purchase</strong></h2> <p>At the time of purchase, couples ought to have discussed their financing options to consolidate enough funds for the land purchase.</p> <p>It&#8217;s so important for a mutual agreement on who contributes what before the payments are made. Afterwards, the ownership is determined by their specific agreement.</p> <p>Each partner has the option to contribute equally in different ratios inclusive half half or a quarter and three quarters of the total price based on their financial strength and agreement with his/her spouse.</p> <p>At times the money contributed by a couple isn’t enough to purchase the land at once; hence at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@amccopropertiesltd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMCCO Properties Limited</a>, we offer couples a flexible payment plan that includes installment plan to pay a deposit and the balance within the remaining time.</p> <p><iframe title="LAND SUBDIVISION: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WITH AMCCO" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0S0l15kxC4?rel=0" width="790" height="444" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p> <p>This option has worked for several happy couples who are part of our land owners community including Mark and Carol who purchased Neema Court and Kamangu greens 3 with the installments plan option.</p> <p>Funding options like loans from banks and saccos are also a good alternative for couples in need of land urgently but their budget is not enough for the purchase.</p> <h2><strong>Title Deed Ownership</strong></h2> <p>After full payments are done, the next task is for the couple to agree on who signs the sale offer and transfer forms which also determine names printed on the final <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/the-truth-about-title-deeds-part-2/">Title Deed.</a></p> <p>Both parties can also sign the documents to signify shared ownership whereby the land belongs to both the wife and husband.</p> <p>This means the land cannot be sold without the other’s authorization and signatures on new transfer documents.</p> <p>When the transfer forms are signed by the two partners, the Title Deed is processed out in 90 days entailing their details to prove ownership.</p> <p>In terms of who keeps the land after one spouse is deceased comes up when signing the transfer form, at this point the couple can decide one to be the next of kin or a member of their family ranging from children to their close siblings or parents.</p> <p>All these details are input in transfer form to ensure all is in order and avoid future conflicts based on the land ownership.</p> <h2><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-genesis-v-annex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-2643 " src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/336870308_1593266937808268_8472629937020880525_n.jpg" alt="amcco plots with ready title deeds" width="446" height="446" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/336870308_1593266937808268_8472629937020880525_n.jpg 1066w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/336870308_1593266937808268_8472629937020880525_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/336870308_1593266937808268_8472629937020880525_n-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/336870308_1593266937808268_8472629937020880525_n-150x150.jpg 150w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/336870308_1593266937808268_8472629937020880525_n-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /></a>Title Deeds</h2> <p>When the <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/truth-about-title-deeds-in-kenya-part-one/">Title Deed</a> is processed out and issued to the couple, it is their choice on who and where the Title Deed is stored safely.</p> <p>A popular preferred and most secure storage facility is the bank which is chargeable to the couple.

Moving from point A to B should never be that tough and hard. No one wants to maneuver on muddy roads when it rains or get a dust coating when it&#8217;s dry out here. Majority of research has proven that land buyers either invest in areas with well done roads or ones that are to be tarmacked to suit their accessibility needs.</p> <p>It&#8217;s even evident from our point of view; as a land selling company, most of our <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/sold-out-properties/">rapidly sold out</a> and successful projects were the ones in areas with tarmacked roads. i.e</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/genesis-gardens-kikuyu/"><strong>Genesis 1</strong></a><strong>, <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/amcco-genesis-gardens-phase-2/">Genesis 2</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-genesis-gardens-phase-3/">Genesis 3</a></strong> in Thigio all sold within 2022</li> <li><strong><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/neema-court-gikambura/">Neema Court</a></strong> in Gikambura sold out in 2021</li> </ul> <p>The big question stands, <em>how does tarmac really affect the pricing of land?</em></p> <p>In this blog we explain fully how tarmac roads cause an increase in land pricing and also share tips on how you can bypass the high prices yet still acquire land in the same tarmacked areas.</p> <ul> <li> <h3><strong>Tarmacked Roads Lead to Formation of New Towns.</strong></h3> </li> </ul> <p>It is well known that major towns in Kenya inclusive Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and Eldoret were well known to be connected by the major highways passing through them. Road networks leads to movement of people, goods and services. It resulted to trading activities and the areas developed into cities just because of the roads.</p> <p>In 2023, so many towns have been developed due to the same factor, including Thika, Kiambu and Kikuyu. The minor towns attract business setups and amenities that would have rather been sorted out in the major towns hence cutting off the stress of moving long distances. Though this comes at a cost; land pricing in the areas near any town are higher than areas with no town at all.</p> <p><strong>Kamangu and Thigio</strong> are progressing into being bigger towns and this causes a continuous rise in land pricing in the areas.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-2060" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0120-300x169.jpg" alt="tarmac" width="660" height="372" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0120-300x169.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0120-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0120-768x432.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0120-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0120-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p> <ul> <li> <h3><strong>Tarmacked Roads Attract Urbanization.</strong></h3> </li> </ul> <p>Investors and Government officials prefer setting up their offices in areas that can be accessed easily in and out. Thereby presence of tarmac roads will foresee establishment of many offices and enterprises contributing to the urbanization of an area. Urbanization is an advantage to the locals residing nearby as they will access services easily from within. Schools and good hospitals are also set up guaranteeing quality health care and education locally. The downside to this for land investors wishing to invest there is the higher prices compared to prices before urbanization.</p> <p>In 2013, Dagoretti road which connects to all our land projects was a poor road with countless portholes. 10 years later, the road is smooth after maintenance and has attributed to formation of Thogoto, Gikambura, Lusigetti, Kamangu and Thigio towns so fast.</p> <p>Construction of the new <a href="https://youtu.be/OHb1fRCtwZo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ha Koinange &#8211; Kiriri road</strong></a> that passes next to Genesis 3 and 4 plots saw an increase in plot pricing in months. Land in these areas was less than 700K back then unlike today where a plot goes for more than 900K. In some areas of Gikambura and Kamangu, plots cost up to 1.5 million each.</p> <p>Luckily enough, we have maintained high value land in the areas for you with just 550K only. Check out <strong>Olive Gardens</strong> <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-olive-gardens/">here.</a></p> <ul> <li> <h3><strong>Tarmacked Roads Guarantee Better Accessibility.</strong></h3> </li> </ul> <p>Aside from the above mentioned factors, this falls as the most considered while purchasing land. Most land investors will scout for land in many locations but will selectively choose the ones with <strong>good road networks</strong>. After continuous evaluation a choice is made and as seen through most of our land clients, areas with tarmac like Thigio are a golden win.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-genesis-gardens-phase-4/">Genesis 4</a><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-genesis-gardens-phase-4/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-2062" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0208-300x169.jpg" alt="tarmac" width="500" height="282" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0208-300x169.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0208-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0208-768x432.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0208-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DJI_0208-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></strong> is less than 2 months old but almost completely sold out; ranking as the most successful project to sell out fast. Majority of the land owners attribute their ownership to the fact that the <em>tarmac passes next to their gates</em>. This guarantees them a smooth ride to and from their homes which is time efficient. The plots are selling at 1.2 million simply because of the added advantage the tarmac offers to the residents. It&#8217;s evident <em>the better the accessibility the higher the price.</em></p> <p>As a land buyer with a slightly lower budget than the prices offered in the areas, it can be challenging to acquire land with already tarmacked roads. However with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amccopropertiesltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMCCO Properties Limited</a>, worry not as we always dedicate ourselves to serve everybody with <strong>high value land solutions</strong>.

This is important to avoid fraudsters and conmen perpetrating to own the land and after payment will either vanish or give you a hard time to get a title deed.<br />The process of searching and determining the actual legal land owner is known as <strong><a href="https://eregulations.invest.go.ke/procedure/239/102?l=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Land Search</a>.</strong></p><h3><strong>How can you ensure the real estate company is legally registered?</strong></h3><p>· Once you obtain the company number, the company search can be done through E-citizen.</p><p>· Log-In your credentials and click on the Business Registration Service Link. Click on the Make Application tab and choose the option Official Search CR12.</p><p>· You will be directed to the find business page where you will input the name of the company or the company number.</p><p>· You will also be required input your details after which you make a payment and the document is ready for download. The CR12 contains all the details you need for the company such as the date of registration, physical address and details of the directors and shareholders.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>An investor has the right to request for certifications of registration of a company. If the company <strong>is not</strong> willing to provide these documents, that is a <strong>red flag</strong> for you as an investor.</em></p><h3><strong>So how do you conduct a land search in Kenya?</strong></h3><p>In this blog we cut across 2 simple and stress-free processes that will unleash the full details to enable you deal with the real land owner be it an individual or real estate company.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> During the actual land search be keen to confirm the following:</p><h4><strong>Title Deed Number Exists at the Lands Registry</strong></h4><p>Beware that with advanced technology, Title deeds can be faked. Documents are molded by fraudsters to perfectly resemble a legit sample and blind the eyes. The first move during the land search is to confirm if that Title deed number is registered and acknowledged by the Land Registry.</p><h4><strong>Full Names of Owner(s)/History of Land Ownership</strong></h4><p>Upon existence of the Title Deed number, check keenly the current land owner(s) and confirm their names as per official Government IDs. It is important to know who owned the land before current owner(s) thereby enquire full history of ownership before purchase. Unfortunately land ownership in Kenya has been a major conflict factor between families and colleagues hence when sold to you unaware, you can be involved in the wrangles later on. To avoid these instances, buy land that has zero ongoing court cases or was acquired on good terms from former sellers.</p><h4><strong>Actual Size of Land</strong></h4><p>It is equally important to know the size and location of land you are about to purchase. Land can be sold as plots measured in hectares or larger portions measured in acres. Involve a surveyor during site visits by any chance you acquire land from an individual owner. Good news is that <a href="https://web.facebook.com/amccopropertiesltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMCCO Properties Limited</a> makes this easier as we have a professional surveyor who measures and sub &#8211; divides our <strong><em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/">plots for sale</a></em></strong> into significant 1/8 upfront. Therefore we cut off the cost and stress for you to hire a surveyor.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1973" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9607-300x200.jpg" alt="land" width="465" height="310" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9607-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9607-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9607-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9607-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9607-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></p><h4><strong>Location of Land</strong></h4><p>Confirm the county trailing down to the sub location in which the land is located in. These details are essential to determine the residential area you will relocate to or setup your investment such as apartments or farms. Moreover, you get to know the area development and urbanization i.e. Road networks, Towns and Government offices near the land property.</p><h4><strong>Property Clearance</strong></h4><p>Don’t be a victim of unpaid land taxes after purchasing land. To avoid being on the wrong side of the County Government, matters regarding taxes and rents should be cleared by the current owner before the land is sold to you.<br />Do an intensive property clearance check and only buy land that has been cleared and certificate provided for confirmation. With the details above, a land buyer counterchecks and affirms the details shared by the seller hence proceeds on or not.</p><h3>    <strong>1. Online Land Search</strong></h3><p>It is the simplest since it can be conducted remotely <strong>using a smartphone/computer and internet.</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Title Deed should be scanned and be ready for upload in soft copy form.</p><ul><li>Using Google or Opera Mini, log in to your <a href="https://www.ecitizen.go.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-citizen portal</a> and specifically select Ministry of Land, Housing and Urban Development tab on the menu.</li><li>Click the Land search option to input the actual Title Deed number then fill in the online land search form. Thereafter confirm the details and submit.</li><li>A pop up option to pay for the search follows whereby you have a variety of payment options, the easiest being M- Pesa or Debit Card.</li><li>Upon payment, a results sheet is produced for printing or future referral. The document stays on the portal long enough if you prefer not to print it and can be accessed anytime you log in.</li></ul><h3><strong>2. Manual Land Search</strong></h3><p>It is the common known way of conducting a land search before technology was introduced to perform the search online. Basically, you visit the nearest land registry in the county where the land is located in.</p><p>Carry alongside a hard copy of;-</p><ul><li>Title Deed</li><li>Seller’s KRA Pin Number document</li><li>Seller’s National ID</li><li>Upon arrival at the offices, request for a Land Search Form (form RL 26) and fill in the details required.</li><li>Attach a copy of the land title, National ID and KRA Pin.</li><li>Submit the form and wait as directed by the Registry officials.</li></ul><p>The search results will be out in between from 3 hours to even 3 working days based on various factors.</p><p>Either way, the search results are produced and issued back to you and based on the information you have a decision to proceed on with your Land buying process or not. As the year progresses, we devote our energy to making this process easier for you.

Kikuyu is centralized between Karen and Ruaka areas giving you a taste of the urban Nairobi with performing schools, better markets, reliable hospitals and entertainment joints.<br />Most important factor is the affordable pricing that beats the high cost of land acquisition within Nairobi Metropolis area.</p><p>Over the 2 years now we have sold hundreds of property capping at less than a million per unit.

Example, talk of money lending services cutting across major brands whose names have been misused to lure innocent Kenyans into fraud.</p><p>Most of the fraud deals seemed so true to decline and amongst them were real estate based. The fraud cases have resulted to more and more parties joining the real estate market each with a different product.<br />These parties are more often individuals or a group with the aim to make quick cash by luring investors then scamming them eventually. To mention, the individual sellers range from actual land owners, brokers and even freelance agents.</p><p><strong>Important note:</strong> <em>Not all real estate individual sellers are fraudsters. Amongst the many, some are legit and fully certified hence operating and offering legal deals to investors. Though, still be warned that aside from cons, other individual sellers have legit products but don’t fully fulfill the purchase process. i.e., <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/the-truth-about-title-deeds-part-2/">Title Deed transfer process.</a> This later delays the ownership of the purchased product inconveniencing the land buyer. The best advice is to avoid such situations by dealing with remarkable real estate companies. </em></p><p>There are more advantages to purchasing land from a real estate company than an individual. The most important one has been mentioned and explained above: <strong>To avoid Fraud Cases.</strong></p><p>Are there more advantages? <strong>The answer is Yes.</strong></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>1. Real Estate Companies Have Offices with Operational Structures.</strong></h3><p>Imagine a situation when you meet up with a seller in a hotel or random meeting place. The reason is that they don’t have an office. To some point this is reasonable for new startups but is a red flag if the seller has been in business for a long duration and can’t set up a professional station to cut deals with client.</p><h3><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1881 alignleft" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6261-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="653" height="435" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6261-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6261-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6261-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6261-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6261-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /></strong></h3><p>It even worsens when you only met the seller once and after making the payment, he/she is nowhere to be seen or found. This leaves you in shock unlike when you would have visited their particular office to trace them down. An office signifies seller’s physical existence and builds trust immediately an investor wants to transact a deal. Investors also do make office visits to pick up documents or hold discussions with their sellers.</p><h3><strong>2.  Real Estate Companies are Accredited and Operate Legally.</strong></h3><p>The law is only able to protect or recover money lost through fraud if only the seller was registered as an existing real estate vendor. This means you can sue a company for not delivering as agreed on common terms whilst unregistered individuals have the openness to refuse liability due to lack of transactional proof with you. The fear of losing certificates ensures each company is on toes to sell and deliver the best quality of land that a buyer chose. Hence you are guaranteed security upon your land purchase.</p><h3><strong>3.  Real Estate Companies Offer Huge Discounts, Affordable Pricing and Other Benefits.</strong></h3><p>More often purchasing land from individuals will be direct to the agreed price. It’s rare to negotiate or receive discounts unlike where companies will consider it a win to retain you. Here at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amccopropertiesltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMCCO Properties Limited</a>, we run seasonal discounts to clients to enable affordable land purchases. Moreover, there are variety of daily giveaways majorly merchandise to specially thank our land investors.</p><h3><strong>4.  Real Estate Companies’ Processes are Reliable and Provide Big Time Solutions.</strong></h3><p>How long would be too long to wait for a Title Deed to be processed? Some say a month others 3 months whilst it adds to even years. Cases of title deed delays occur often when deals are from Individual sellers.</p><h3><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1882 alignleft" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6878-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="591" height="394" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6878-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6878-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6878-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6878-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6878-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></strong></h3><p><strong>Why? </strong>Some don’t even follow up with the land registry while others are too busy searching for more and new investors. This has inconvenienced so many land buyers over the years most complaining of deception. A title deed was promised to be out in 4 months but came 4 years later; isn’t that quite bad?<br />At <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amccoproperties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMCCO Properties Limited</a> we cut off the stress such that in less than 90 days your title deed is out. Thereafter we parcel it or invite you for a pick up at our offices. <strong>How simple is that?</strong></p><p>Solution wise there are a variety of <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/">properties available</a></em> such that an investor either buys to build or to <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-olive-gardens/">later sell after land appreciation</a>.</em><br />Unfortunately, most individual sellers have limited land for sale in terms of size or purpose. Example, a seller selling land for speculation will disadvantage a buyer interested in an already developed area to build on.</p><p>Having a variety of solutions to pick on the suitable one is better than being limited to one or none. The list doesn’t end there. More advantages have been experienced by different land buyers and we can only emphasize a few for today.</p><p>Any enquiry about this blog, do contact us through <strong>0701 293 199</strong> or share your thoughts via our email at <em><strong>amccoproperties@gmail.com.</strong></em></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </div> </div> </div> ",

Imagine owning a plot within Nairobi with only 550K? That sounds interesting!</p><p><strong>SUPER GOOD NEWS!!</strong> <em>With only 500,000 Kenyan Shillings, you can get to own land within the Nairobi Metropolis Area in Kikuyu!</em></p><h3><strong>Why 500K Not a Million Like Other Projects?</strong></h3><p>Olive Gardens is so special and its investors will be amongst the luckiest in the Kenyan real estate market because with the alarming land scarcity and ownership chaos in Nairobi, finding plots with a budget less than a million is a nightmare. In Kikuyu, areas near the town sell at 8 million and above whilst areas 10 minutes further are a bit<br />affordable at 1 million and above.

This is majorly attributed to the high demand in property ownership be it plots, land, a house or rental units. When it comes to land, profit is gained after land is bought, value added and sold later after a definite duration at a higher price.</p><p><strong>Pro Fact:</strong> <em>Profits gained from land are so huge ranging from thousands to millions per sale. This calls for investors willing to reap big to invest in the industry. In this </em><em>blog, we crack down how to gain huge profit through selling land after adding value to it (<strong>Land Speculation</strong>) </em></p><p><em>Also read &#8211; <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/5-ways-to-add-value-to-your-plot/"><strong>How to Add Value To Your Plot</strong></a></em></p><h3><strong>What Is Land Speculation? </strong></h3><p>It is the process of purchasing land, adding value to it over a period of time then reselling at a higher price than you bought it.</p><p>Example; <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/amcco-genesis-gardens-phase-2/">Genesis Phase 2</a> plots in Thigio were selling at Ksh 799,000 by March 2022. Upon completion the owners built on the land whilst others laid farming<br />and greenhouse activities. The plots that were bought for speculation in the same area currently cost upto 1 million Kenyan shillings in less than 6 months. This was due to the rapid growth in the neighbourhood and also <a href="https://youtu.be/OHb1fRCtwZo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>tarmacking of</em> the access roads</a> passing by. The land investors will now gain a profit of <strong>over Ksh 200,000</strong> when selling the land.</p><h3><strong>What Land Is Best Suitable For Speculation? </strong></h3><p>Land in a rapidly developing area with an appreciation rate of over 50% per year. Land buyers are attracted by land that favours them in an all rounded way be it from amenities, social facilities, ideal location, land attributes i.e red soil etc. Such lands are easily available for purchase in developing areas. Note that <strong>land in developing areas is way far off from under developed areas</strong>; some developing areas are way tarmacked to a certain point or fully murram while under developed areas have unusable roads. This calls for you to <em><a href="https://youtu.be/ZN-IlpQlvqY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invest in land in a developing area</a></em> such that when it gets done, you will resell the land at higher prices.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> <em>The rate at which an area is developing at determines how soon and high you can resell the land. Therefore it is wise to buy land for speculation in</em><br /><em>a rapid developing area like Kikuyu which is at 50% plus per annum.</em></p><h3><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1753" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6787-300x200.jpg" alt="speculation" width="603" height="402" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6787-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6787-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6787-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6787-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_6787-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" />What factors Define The Best Land Suitable For Speculation?</strong></h3><p><strong>1. The Land Location </strong></p><p>It should be within a Metropolis area i.e. Nairobi Metropolis area which covers even Kikuyu with our profitable plots for sale. The location should be accessible from the main roads with direct access roads.</p><p><strong>Note;</strong> <em>Accessibility in areas with land for speculation mostly has murram not tarmac roads. This creates huge room for profitability when the roads are afterwards tarmacked and the plots can be sold then to buyers interested in the tarmac. The land should be situated in a safe area whereby the clients will be</em><br /><em>comfortable visiting and buying for their specific needs.</em></p><p><strong>2. Nearby Reliable Suitable Amenities </strong></p><p>Schools, hospitals and religious facilities act significantly for land buyers who want to build their residential homes. Hence ensure the land you intend to purchase<br />is located near these amenities. More importantly, consider purchasing land in areas that have electricity and fresh water supply throughout i.e. Kikuyu.</p><p><strong>3. Super Affordable Land Pricing.</strong></p><p>The secret to successful land speculation is buying land in a developing areas unlike an already developed area. Land in these areas is relatively cheap and<br />offers a huge profit bracket after the developments are completed i.e <a href="https://youtu.be/OHb1fRCtwZo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tarmacking of Roads</a>.</p><p>After purchasing the land, the first stage of your profitable business venture is achieved.

For example, when you visit the supermarket, the first thing on your hand is the shopping cart followed by identifying and picking the items on the shelves. Eventually you line up and pay for your order then leave with the packaged item(s).<br />When buying plots, similar procedures happen from the moment you desire to own land until the actual moment you receive a <a href="https://youtu.be/nUqhzDtzD1M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title Deed</a> registered under you.<br />These procedures and steps form up the <em><a href="https://youtu.be/6RgDnwnADKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales process</a></em>. In this blog, we explain the simple, seamless and stress-free sales process with AMCCO Properties Limited.</p><h3><strong>• Enquiry Stage</strong></h3><p>80% of our land investors started their journey at this stage. Through our online campaigns on <a href="https://web.facebook.com/amccopropertiesltd/?_rdc=3&amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amccopropertiesltd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://l.instagram.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCflE29jZRKtdfcCp7dTdfwg&amp;e=ATMyI0nH5G9HgjEAumkK3ojAawufRhnVkguQJjZVgWyqZ2dWXxf1BmWlRRjPo5gsBJiBF0KcPpdFMg_WMx7pVRc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, Website and WhatsApp, interested land investors will often send us several enquiry messages whereby we pick up the conversation from there. We also follow up on comments through friendly calls and chats answering all questions related to our <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/">plots for sale</a></em>. At this stage, our relationship managers engage the land investor in a conversation and the feedback obtained helps us guide the land investor to the most suitable land property.</p><p>Discussions revolve around the intended land purpose; either residential or speculation, the amenities available, acquisition duration, Title Deeds Transfer and <em><a href="https://youtu.be/FBSW_tqKb0M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flexible payment methods</a>. </em>Useful materials inclusive the property catalogue, mutation, photos and videos are shared by the respective Relationship Manager. Eventually, the investor has a decision to make; either to opt out or book a free site visit to the actual land.</p><h3><strong>• Office Tour And Briefing</strong></h3><p>This stage accommodates two groups of investors, one who proceeds from the enquiry stage, and the walk in. Basically, 20% of our land investors are walk-ins. They either were referred by <em><a href="https://youtu.be/7_WJBLJ6KTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a former happy client</a></em> or heard about us then decided to visit our offices physically without enquiring online. Upon arrival, the investor is received warmly by our receptionist or alternatively by the managers available. The conversation about interests in our <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/">plots for sales</a></em> starts from there.</p><p>Also, we do invite land investors who enquired online or via call and booked a site visit to pass by <em><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Amcco+Properties+Ltd+Gikambura+dagoretti+road+Kikuyu/@-1.283078,36.6331189,10z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x182f6f1151ec97bf:0x8263a92a3a3c8333!2m2!1d36.6331189!2d-1.283078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the office</a></em> for some coffee. Through an interactive session, we tour the investors through our offices, introduce them to the AMCCO space and also showcase testimonials from former land investors.<br />Afterwards a briefing occurs where we visually guide the investor on the property through videos and photos. They make a pick and instantly we drive off to the property location in our executive van for free.</p><h3><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1720" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/WhatsApp-Image-2022-12-02-at-23.32.24-300x200.jpeg" alt="plot" width="437" height="291" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/WhatsApp-Image-2022-12-02-at-23.32.24-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/WhatsApp-Image-2022-12-02-at-23.32.24-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/WhatsApp-Image-2022-12-02-at-23.32.24-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/WhatsApp-Image-2022-12-02-at-23.32.24.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" />• Site Visit</strong></h3><p>All our plots for sale in Kamangu and Thigio are exactly less than 15 minutes away hence guarantee you a short but quick ride to and from the offices. At the site, the investor is open to viewing the land, observe the surrounding environment, measure to confirm the plot size, evaluate the drainage, weather and type of soil. The relationship manager further shares history of the land, location and neighborhoods to help the investor understand more about the property.</p><p>This is the most important stage and has contributed to majority of land investors buying from us. They say seeing is believing, our land investors are convinced and ready to purchase only after viewing the actual land.</p><h3><strong>• Engagement And Discussions</strong></h3><p>After the site visit, we drive back to our offices for a thanksgiving and further discussion on a way forward. The investor(s) gets to talk about the identified piece of land whilst the manager lays down the strategic steps to acquire it. Discussions about reservation and payment follow afterwards.</p><h3><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1719" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC_6778-300x200.jpg" alt="plot" width="503" height="335" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC_6778-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC_6778-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC_6778-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC_6778-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DSC_6778-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" />• Payment</strong></h3><p>With two available <em><a href="https://youtu.be/FBSW_tqKb0M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flexible payment methods</a></em>, the client picks the most reliable and efficient one in between cash payment or installments of up to 3 months. Cash payment is instant while installation payment is initiated by a booking fee and the rest paid in 3 equal installments.<br />For example, the New Olive Gardens in Kamangu has plots worth Kshs. 550,000 each paid in cash or Kshs. 650,000 paid in installments. When an investor opts to pay in installments, he/she will pay Ksh 50,000 then pay Ksh 200,000 consecutively for 3 months.<br />Payments are often wired through bank transfer to our cooperative bank account and immediately after confirmation a receipt is produced. The receptionist drafts a sales agreement which is signed by the lawyer and the investor and this marks the ownership of the plot. Afterwards we initiate a Title deed transfer in collaboration with Kiambu County Lands Registry as illustrated in this blog <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/the-truth-about-title-deeds-part-2/">https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/the-truth-about-title-deeds-part-2/</a></em></p><h3><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1549" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-300x200.jpg" alt="plot" width="424" height="282" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" />• Official Title Deed Handover</strong></h3><p>Processing the Title deed officially kicks off after the plot full payment is completed by the land investor. This process has charges that total up Ksh 30,000 and in less than 90 days the <a href="https://youtu.be/nUqhzDtzD1M" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Individual Title Deed</em></a> is produced and sent to our offices by the registry team. We there afterwards organize with the investor for them to pick up the document at our offices or alternatively have it parceled to their location on our bill. During the official handover, there are several remarkable gifts for every land investor.<br />This stage doesn’t mark end of the investor’s journey with AMCCO but rather opens up new doors for friendship and joining our community of happy land owners.<br />The relationship manager inducts the investor into ensuring they settle in comfortably in the new area. This includes guiding them on where to shop or also the best amenities in the area, even better, more about the society.</p><p>As the year ends, our community of happy land owners is broadening daily. We welcome you to join us and experience the joy of owning land within the fastest growing neighborhood in the Nairobi Metropolis Area.</p><p><strong>PS:</strong> FREE MBUZI FOR YOU!!

This applies in real estate whereby festive seasons are considered peak and on demand seasons. Working individuals get guaranteed bonuses from their employers or business and majority consider investment as their first option. It’s when real estate companies launch <em><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/genesis-gardens-phase-4-plots-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new plots for sale</a></em> which are profitable investments if purchased for speculation.</p> <p><strong>Case Study:</strong> A plot located in Thigio purchased during December 2022 will cost 60%+ more in December 2022.</p> <p>These results are from our analysis of successful projects inclusive <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/amcco-genesis-gardens-phase-2/">Genesis phase 2</a> which speculated in less than 4 months after selling out after its launch in January 2022.</p> <p>Currently the success of Genesis 1,2 and 3 has opened doors for the <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/genesis-gardens-phase-4-plots-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Genesis phase 4</a> selling during this festive season 2022. The project is of high interest due to the fact that it touches the tarmac that links to Dagoretti Road.</p> <h3><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-26-at-08.55.03-300x225.jpeg" alt="land" width="479" height="359" /></strong></h3> <h3><strong>• Plenty of Freebies, Giveaways and Discounts.</strong></h3> <p>With the urgency to close the year with high sales, each land selling company initiates attractive schemes for you to benefit from. Simply, you invest in a plot for sale with a company and in exchange they appreciate you with a freebie, gift or even better a discount for your plot purchase.</p> <p>This Christmas 2022, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amccopropertiesltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMCCO Properties Limited</a> has loaded its offices with merchandise dedicated to all land investors who choose us.</p> <p>Ranging from hoodies, caps, key holders to water bottles etc., the gifts are issued weekly at our offices or parceled to our clients. We have a <em><a href="https://youtu.be/7N-_i0kCbw0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special discount of 5%</a></em> running till 30th November 2022, and so far several new land owners have benefited purchasing high value land for less than usual price.</p> <h3><strong>• Land Prices are Relatively Low.</strong></h3> <p>Post December, as the new year emerges; so does generally higher market prices. This means that land sold in December 2022 slightly under 1 million Kenyan shillings will sell over 1 million Kenyan shillings as the next year starts to count.</p> <p>To avoid the situation, land investors consider purchasing plots for sale during the festive seasons before prices escalate after.</p> <p>Land selling companies will also reduce the market price to convert more interested buyers and rapidly exhaust the remaining pieces of land for that year.</p> <p>To avoid future regrets, we encourage you to prepare earlier and buy land when the prices are quite lower than usual.</p> <h3><strong>• Easy and Guaranteed Funding from Banks and Saccos.</strong></h3> <p>As the year ends, financial institutions allocate more funds for their clients that are distributed as savings grants and loans.</p> <p>Through presenting <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/truth-about-title-deeds-in-kenya-part-one/">Title Deeds</a> as evidence to your bank or Sacco this festive season, chances of getting the funding are high. With sufficient funds you can purchase land without any payment stress.</p> <p><strong>Pro-Tip: <em>You can borrow a loan to purchase land, let it to speculate then sell at a higher price, pay the loan and enjoy the profit. This profitable idea is easy since all you do is take care and maintain your land to propel its value as illustrated in this blog &#8211; <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/5-ways-to-add-value-to-your-plot/">Ways to Add Value to Your Land</a></em></strong></p> <h3>•<strong> Allowance for Negotiation by Land Selling Companies.</strong></h3> <p>As mentioned earlier, during festive seasons land selling companies are in a rush to exhaust pending land property and start a fresh with the new upcoming year.</p> <p>To enable quick closing sales, negotiations that favor both the company and clients are allowed.<br /> <iframe title="5 REASONS WHY TO INVEST DURING THE FESTIVE SEASON!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZsVMbvLeI0" width="806" height="453" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p>This opportunity enables you to mention a significant budget (less than usual but valid in the average land market) and based on the companies’ evaluation, you will be sold a <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-genesis-gardens-phase-4/">valuable piece of land</a> that accommodates it.</p> <h3>•<strong> End Year is a Rainy season.</strong></h3> <p>Since October 2022, heavy rains have been experienced in most Kenyan regions thus flooding in areas with poor drainage.</p> <p>This is the best time to visit and evaluate the drainage of an area. Areas that have poor drainage will likely flood hence warning you against purchase land there.</p> <p>The rainy season will progress till January 2023 hence this calls for action for you to identify areas of interest and evaluate the drainage before purchasing land.</p> <p>On the other hand, when you visit and find the area drainage to be averagely good then it’s a go ahead to invest in the land before its depleted.</p> <p>Hopefully, the above information has enlightened you on why the festive seasons are the best when buying land.</p> <p>If you have any land buying plans and by now you haven’t made a purchase yet, this is the best time to do so considering all the above advantages at your disposal.</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> As we wrap up this festive season 2022, enjoy numerous discounts and gifts from AMCCO Properties Limited.

This went on until recent times where there has been over population in major estates that is vastly catching up and causing worries.<br />The need to relocate near Nairobi is fighting against the availability of <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-genesis-gardens-phase-4/"><em>prime and affordable plots</em></a> to settle on. Land has become scarce due to the construction of numerous rental flats and apartments while the few remaining areas are extremely expensive for average land investors.

Run Basic Utilities To The Land</strong></h3><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1603 alignright" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_1054-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="333" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_1054-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_1054-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_1054-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_1054-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_1054-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" /></p><p><strong>• Clean Fresh Water and Sewerage Systems Installation</strong></p><p>Sanitation as part of our daily lives is only fulfilled by supply of clean fresh water. Additionally, farming activities thrive well where there’s plenty of water. </p><p>Therefore, ensure you liaise with the nearest water company for installation f water to your land or property.</p><p>In our phases, <a href="https://limuruwater.go.ke/index.php/component/content/?view=featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Limuru Water And Sewerage Company</a> is very proximal to our <strong>properties in <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/new-genesis-gardens-phase-3/">Thigio</a> and <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/amcco-grace-gardens-kamangu/">Kamangu</a></strong> hence this makes water installation quick and affordable. To eradicate waste water from your property, have a plumber set up a functional sewerage system. This ensures you have clean water in and waste water out.</p><p><strong>PRO-TIP: <em>Establish A Reliable Drainage System: </em></strong>Note that the major challenge likely to occur after installation of water and sewerage systems is improper drainage. This can be seized by involving a professional plumber to install main pipes that connect your system to the community’s drainage system. After this process you can be assured of zero flooding or impurification issues due to improper drainage.</p><ul><li><strong>Electricity and Internet Connection</strong></li></ul><p>On the contrary, imagine life full of electricity blackouts or zero power at all. This would have made life hectic like decades ago when stable electricity was a thing only widespread in the capital. However, with the urbanization of local towns e.g. Thigio, extension of power lines into the interiors has been accomplished to serve all residents.<br /><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1600 alignleft" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_4677-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="290" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_4677-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_4677-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_4677-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_4677-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_4677-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" /></strong>Additionally, the urge to connect to the digital world; working from home, online schooling or browsing on social media is rising drastically. You have the opportunity to join along by installing affordable internet from various multiple telecommunication suppliers sited in Kikuyu Town (Only 10 minutes from Kamangu Town)</p><p><strong>Value: Having continuous water, electricity and internet supply to your property streamlines your family’s livelihood and also attracts tenants moving to rent on your property.</strong></p><p>All the way from Kikuyu Town through Gikambura and past Kamangu you will view internet cables on poles; this is the rapid connectivity that will improve the value of your property. Connecting your residential home or rental property to the internet enables digital connectivity among the residents which is a plus for them.</p><h3><strong>2. Set Structures On It</strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1588" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3047-300x200.jpg" alt="plot" width="485" height="323" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3047-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3047-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3047-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3047-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_3047-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></h3><p><strong>• Homestead &#8211; Build a House.</strong></p><p>Majority of plot for sale buyers’ end goal is to build a home after purchasing the land. More than often land that has a homestead signifies the existence of a settlement in the area. This increases the chances of more people buying and building their homes next to yours. The value comes when you gain neighbors and develop a community together simply because you initiated the move to build your home in the area. Living in a well populated neighborhood is much more comfortable and safer than building to live next to zero neighbors.</p><p><strong>• Rental Units &#8211; Build a Bungalow, AirBnb Or Apartments for Rental.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, for some plot for sale buyers, investing in rental properties is a big catch. Building rental properties on your land attracts tenants who in the long run return with pay for residing there. With this money you will have sorted back the land purchase amount and immediately settle for a long-term rental profit business.</p><p><strong>PRO-TIP: <em>There is a high demand on rentals in Kamangu and Thigio sue to the urbanization of the <a href="https://youtu.be/dpfIbWFliHs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newly Commissioned Ndeiya Sub County.</a> Much of the population is moving to reside in the area, guaranteeing a high return on rental investments.</em></strong></p><p><strong>• Farm Yard or Ranch &#8211; Rear Animals, Grow Some Food/Cash Crops or Setup a Green House.</strong></p><p>Farming as a substantial venture that thrives well in Ndeiya. This is made possible due to the land&#8217;s rich and red fertile soil. To their advantage, each local resident has embraced both subsistence and cash crop farming commonly yielding greens, maize and beans.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> <em><strong>Since the pre-colonial period, Ndeiya area was historically famous as a grazing yard with huge fields of green pastures hence the kikuyu derived name &#8211; “Ndeiya”.</strong></em></p><p>With a surplus of the favorable area climate (averagely cool and wet) you can rear domestic animals i.e., cows, goats or chicken to supply milk and eggs for consumption at home or for selling to local shops nearby. Alternatively, an investment in a ranch or green house to commercially supply the markets with large quantity consumables i.e., meat, milk, vegetables is an open opportunity for you.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1586" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-14-at-16.41.19-300x200.jpeg" alt="plot" width="368" height="245" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-14-at-16.41.19-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-14-at-16.41.19-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-14-at-16.41.19-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-14-at-16.41.19.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></p><h3><strong>3. Enhance The Land&#8217;s Apearance</strong></h3><p>Our eyes are attracted by the beauty and outlook of a property in an area. This also applies when it comes to a parcel of land. When land is left idle, bushes and shrubs grow rapidly initiating an ugly look. The solution is landscaping and gardening. Take time to level your land and grow flowers or aesthetic plants on it. If land is left unutilized for years but these gardens are still thriving then there’s a good impression to your neighbors and anyone visiting the area.</p><h3><strong>4. Set Borders On The Land</strong></h3><p>Fencing is advisable after you have purchased a plot for sale in a new area. This creates a barrier that keeps off trespassers from misusing your land without consent.<br />More often it is hard to monitor your land when you reside far from it and illegal activities i.e. Burning charcoal and Over grazing might be initiated by those trespassers. To curb such activities, you should fence your land suitably with a quality mesh or barbed wire and quality hard poles. This also safeguards any construction valuables i.e., gates, building materials from theft.</p><h3><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1587" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-17-at-09.42.02-300x225.jpeg" alt="plot" width="484" height="363" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-17-at-09.42.02-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-17-at-09.42.02-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-17-at-09.42.02-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-17-at-09.42.02-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-17-at-09.42.02.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" />5.

(4 Easy steps Explained)</h3><p>Immediately after land shopping, identifying and paying for the actual land, a new chapter full of legal processes arise to ensure your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUqhzDtzD1M&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freehold Title Deed</a> is<br />processed. The processes align instantly after conducting a <a href="https://www.hudumakenya.go.ke/service/50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Land Search</a> as illustrated here:</p><h3>1. Obtain Transfer Documents</h3><p>There are various steps here which require you to apply, pay and obtain the necessary documents:</p><ul><li><strong>a) Rates Clearance certificate:</strong> It is issued by the county government lands registry office. The process is done by the seller&#8217;s lawyer, whereby he/she visits the local county government lands office to check for any outstanding land rates. Arrears are paid for then afterwards a land rate clearance certificate issued.</li><li><strong>b) Land Rent Clearance Certificate:</strong> It is issued by the commissioner of lands upon payment of all outstanding land rents.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>c) Transfer Form:</strong> It is applied to the commissioner of lands by the buyer’s lawyer after obtaining the certificates. This application is made in writing by the lawyer to the lands commissioner then the prescribed form executed for consent to transfer the desired property after the payment.</li><li><strong>d) File the transfer instrument at the land office for assessment of stamp duty payable on the transfer:</strong> The buyer&#8217;s lawyer drafts a transfer which has to be approved by the seller&#8217;s lawyer before it is submitted to the land’s registry for assessment.</li></ul><h3>2. Obtain Valuation for Stamp Duty</h3><ul><li><strong>a) Inspection by a land officer:</strong> After submission of the draft transfer to the land’s office, an inspector visits the site to verify the state of the property and the development.</li><li><strong>b) Property Valuation by a Government Evaluator:</strong> The evaluator visits the land to evaluate and verify the indicated purchase price of the land in order to ensure accurate payment of tax <a href="https://kra.go.ke/helping-tax-payers/faqs/stamp-duty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(stamp duty)</a></li></ul><h3>3. Stamp Duty Payment</h3><ul><li><strong>a) Value Endorsement for stamp duty and assessment:</strong> Once stamp duty forms are fully filled, the stamp duty officer accesses and indicates the stamp duty payable.</li><li><strong>b) Stamp Duty Payments:</strong> The payments are finalized through banks by use of banker’s cheque to the commissioner of domestic taxes on behalf of the commissioner of land.</li><li><strong>c) Obtaining a franked document:</strong> Once <a href="https://kra.go.ke/helping-tax-payers/faqs/stamp-duty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stamp duty</a> is paid, the transfer documents are submitted for franking to confirm that the taxes have been fully paid.</li></ul><h3>4. Land Registration</h3><p><strong>Pay registration fees: </strong>After all the payment processes, submit the completed documents with the land&#8217;s office for registration of the transfer. After successful registration the buyer receives:</p><ul><li>An Original Title Deed with his/her name on it.</li><li>Registered Transfer Forms.</li><li>The pay-in-slip for custom duty.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1569" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_2724-300x200.jpg" alt="title deed" width="605" height="403" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_2724-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_2724-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_2724-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_2724-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_2724-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /><strong>Tip: </strong>After a few weeks, the land buyer should conduct a new search with the land&#8217;s commission to check if the land is now registered with a Title Deed in his/her name.</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Most of illustrated processes consume a lot of time and effort and can turn out tiresome for some land buyers.

At this stage you lay down the available options and weigh the best. But beware at this stage you do encounter numerous circumstances with either positive/negative consequences. In this blog, we guide you on the dos and don’ts while shopping for land; so as to ensure you have a positive outcome eventually.</p><h3>Do</h3><p>Visit the Site (actual land) or send a trustworthy representative on your behalf. During the site visit; Ask questions regarding the land and area to equip you with relevant information that suits your queries. i.e.</p><p><strong>• The history of the land.</strong><br /><strong>• Type of soil.</strong><br /><strong>• Unpaid Land rates.</strong><br /><strong>• Drainage of the land.</strong><br /><strong>• Basic amenities e.g., Water and Electricity.</strong><br /><strong>• Security of the Area.</strong><br /><strong>• Available opportunities with the land e.g., Farming, Ranching, Homestead</strong></p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The site visit proves physical existence of the land being sold while answering questions regarding location, topography, drainage, amenities etc.</p><h3>Don’t</h3><p>Don’t involve too many 3rd parties during the site visit. In often instances, they might mislead you with “their facts and thoughts” about the land. At this point you end up confused hence pausing your buying plans. Instead make an affirmative decision based on your personal evaluation about the land.</p><h3>Do</h3><p>Conduct thorough search about the real estate company’s land selling success, for example <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Amcco+Properties+Ltd+Gikambura+dagoretti+road+Kikuyu/@-1.283078,36.6331189,10z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x182f6f1151ec97bf:0x8263a92a3a3c8333!2m2!1d36.6331189!2d-1.283078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit AMCCO’s offices,</a> website and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amccopropertiesltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media pages</a> or enquire from our happy clients about their successful land ownership journey with us.</p><h3><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1546 alignleft" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_6780-300x200.jpg" alt="land" width="639" height="426" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_6780-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_6780-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_6780-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_6780-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_6780-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /></h3><p><strong>Tip:</strong> While researching about the land seller’s success, check out these important aspects:</p><p><strong>• Positive Customer review</strong> (should outweigh negative reviews)<br /><strong>• Property Sell Rate</strong> (fast-paced sell rate signifies high interest from land buyers)<br /><strong>• Purchase process</strong> (should be simple, convenient and achievable)</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> You will have the affirmative proof to proceed on a deal with the selling company.</p><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><h3>Don’t</h3><p>Don’t blindly cut deals with any company/seller without tangible information of their existence or proven land selling success. This simply means evade unregistered land selling companies and brokers. Instances when your urgency to buy land is high do attract various uncertified land sellers willing to take advantage. If you end up paying without reliable information about the land, purchase process or former project success; inconveniences like <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/truth-about-title-deeds-in-kenya-part-one/">Title Deed</a> process delays might occur.</p><h3>Do</h3><p>With 100’s of running real estate companies, it’s wise enough to investigate the company’s credibility and legitimacy information. Liaise with a Lawyer or Company to share their registration documents. Additionally, request to see the Land Mother Title registered under the company/seller.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1549" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-300x200.jpg" alt="land" width="605" height="403" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_8527-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> This information determines legitimate sellers and keeps you off from fraudsters and con cases.</p><h3>Don’t</h3><p>Don’t just shop and buy land randomly (from anyone; anywhere. The land market has various entities competing to sell to you; brokers, individual owners, and companies.</p><p>There in between some mediocre entities will provide too-sweet acquisition methods i.e.</p><p> </p><p>• Low payment rates often below average market value.<br />• Unrealistic acquisition processes e.g., Title Deed in less than a week.<br />• Additional bribes to fasten the land acquisition process.<br />• Very huge discounts e.g., below 50% selling price.</p><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Without the legal knowledge about the seller’s credibility, you will be frauded. The seller is likely to vanish with your money leaving no trace of the deal you cut with them.

Most land buyers consider building their homes and structures in regions with endless opportunities.<br />Apparently, worries and doubts chip in during land shopping as most prospects are new to the region and unaware if there are benefits and opportunities worth their investment. This can slow down your land ownership plans and even put your building aspirations at a standstill.</p><p>At this stage, it’s even stressful to discover a real estate company that will smoothly help you get a plot for sale that will suit your needs.

Processing Your Title Deed Instantly.</h4><p>Once the full payment is complete, we work with the land legal team to initiate your <a href="https://youtu.be/nUqhzDtzD1M" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Individual Title deed</em></a> transfer. It takes less than 90 days to hand over the land ownership documents to you. The Ministry of Lands &#8211; Kiambu County Government has streamlined the process to be faster and more efficient for land buyers within the county.</p><h4>2. Immediate Access and Ownership to your plot.</h4><p>To ascertain ownership, we allow the client to fence his/her plot with chain links and quality hard poles that mark the perimeter borders. This comes in handy in ensuring that new prospects are aware that the property is owned and furthermore keeps intruders from accessing the land.<br />Fencing the plot is affordable with all materials being locally outsourced. We even organize a team of energetic men to perform the fencing to save you time.</p><h4><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1447" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_3023-300x200.jpg" alt="plots for sale thigio" width="530" height="353" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_3023-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_3023-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_3023-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_3023-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_3023-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></h4><h4>3.

And how affordable can it be during these times?</p> <p>Kenya has a huge land market and it&#8217;s likely for any land buyer to sink through in search of the best times to purchase valuable plots for sale while sparing an extra coin. Be assured that after reading this blog you will be in the limelight ready to step ahead.</p> <p>In this article, we break down the 5 Best times to Purchase Plots For Sale in 2022 while considering affordable pricing and other secondary factors.</p> <h2>1. Low Peak Land Sale Seasons</h2> <p>In months January &#8211; February when prospects are focused on pre and post-December budgets i.e., Festivities, School Fees etc. there is low interest in plots for sale. At this time land prices are highly discounted due to the low seasonal sales hence this might be a prime time to buy land since plots for sale are at relatively lower prices than usual.</p> <h2>2. When it’s Wet and Rainy</h2> <p>Drainage is an important factor when buying any plot for sale, especially one to build a home on. No one wants a flooding experience anywhere near their beautiful home, but sadly it occasionally happens. This&nbsp; happens when a client buys land while it is a completely dry season with no signs of drainage. Fortunately, when it rains you gain a better experience on drainage conditions of the land whereby you will precisely decide whether to buy or not.</p> <h2> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1343" style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_2027-300x200.jpg" alt="plots for sale in thigio" width="361" height="241" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_2027-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_2027-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_2027-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_2027-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG_2027-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" />3. During Infrastructure Development in the Area</h2> <p>Tarmac roads aid smooth rides to your destination quickly. But it comes at a high cost. Land Proximity to main roads and towns is a privilege that skyrockets land prices in an area. It’s advisable to spot a developing metropolitan area in advance with either ongoing tarmacking of roads or commissioned roads to be tarmacked in the near future. This way you will buy plots for sale affordably within the standard duration and be able to access the completed tarmac.</p> <h4>N.B- Buying plots for sale in areas with ready tarmacked roads will cost you twice to thrice the budget you could buy before tarmacking. Based on a client’s budget and urgency to own the land, a decision can be made.</h4> <h2>4. During Yearly Celebrations &amp; Seasons</h2> <p>It is relatable that on special holidays like Christmas and Easter, we all focus on spending time with loved ones, visiting upcountry, or attending ceremonies. This season causes a rapid decrement in land sales thus realtor companies have to reduce their prices to attract the few interested parties at the time. Unfortunately, this season is a maximum of a week hence first come first serve. The prices escalate to normal or more once the holidays are over.</p> <h2>5. When You Have The Time, Need &amp; Money!</h2> <p>Finally, guaranteed you have the time, need, and money, invest in affordable prime plots for sale.

There were some challenges facing this area for years. Some Include:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Lack of Title deeds</strong></li> </ol> <p>For the longest time, several parcels of land in Kamangu that had been surveyed and Awarded to people in the 1990’s did not have title deeds. However, Since Feb 2022, The Government carried out a verification and Validation Exercise, after which in August 2022, they issues over 14000 title deeds, some of which were for the greater Kamangu Area.</p> <ol start="2"> <li><strong>Water</strong></li> </ol> <p>Water has been a challenge in the Larger Nachu, Kamangu Region, with the only source of water being a few boreholes. One Notable fact is that Ndeiya has no river, therefore, water is a significant issue.</p> <p>However, over the last one Year, the county government of Kiambu installed piping and a system to have water in Ondiri Swamp be pumped to Kamangu. The infrastructure is already set up and people around the area are now enjoying a reliable water connection</p> <ol start="3"> <li><strong>Electricity</strong></li> </ol> <p>Through the Governments Last mile Connectivity the area now have adequate Electricity coverage. Majority of the areas in kamangu also have 3 phase Electricity access.</p> <ol start="4"> <li><strong>Security</strong></li> </ol> <p>Majority of people who wished to buy and settle in kamangu faced some serious security challenges. This was caused by the remoteness and lack of security agencies in the area. Currently, the area is now served by, Lusigetti Police Station, Nachu Police Station, Kamangu Police Post, Thigio Police Station (SuB County headquarters).</p> <p>The area has now been made a sub county and now the security agencies have been supplemented by the presence of DCC, DCIO and the OCPD of Ndeiya Sub- County</p> <p>With all this challenges addressed, Kamangu is the next Frontier in Kiambu, and also within the Nairobi Metrolis. As stated here-in the area is already experiencing a high demand, and this is expect to continue as more people settle</p> ",

It will also have 4 locations and 7 Sublocations.</p> <p>Previously, some parts of Ndeiya were in Kikuyu constituency, while the largest part was in Limuru Consitituency</p> <h3><strong>Benefits for <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/">Ndeiya</a> Sub-County </strong></h3> <p>According to Amcco Properties Limited the benefits for Ndeiya Sub- County will be massive. First, as a sub county, it means the Ndeiya is a Constituency of its own and it will have a Member of Pariament (MP) to represent it. Secondly, it means the area will have two MCAs, from the current one.</p> <p>As a result, it will enjoy the funds allocated to the MPs from the Constituency fund. Amcco Porperties notes that this is just an example of the benefits that will arise from resources being brought closer.</p> <p>Espan from Amcco states that, “Ndeiya will now be compared to the mighty towns of kiambu, such as Ruiru and Thika, its time the sleeping Giant wakes up”</p> <p>James Kimani the MD Amcco properties states, “Thanks to the Kenyan Government for facilitating this, it has been a prayer for most Investors in Ndeiya. Going forward Ndeiya will see massive rise of towns such as Thigio, Gikambura and Kamangu”.</p> <h3><strong>Sub County Offices </strong></h3> <p>The sub county offices were commissioned in 2021 and are currently being constructed. It is estimated they will be operational from 2023. What this means is that all county services will be provided from <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/">Thigio</a>, and not Limuru. All Land Transactions and Licenses will be applied from the county offices in Thigio.</p> <h3><strong>Investment Opportunities </strong></h3> <p>According to Amcco Properties, Huge investment Opportunities now present themselves in this Ndeiya area. The once Sleep village has awakened. New government offices, means there will be demand for residential units and commercial units and business will start to thrive.</p> <p>Thousands of employees from Government will need places to live. We expect this area to experience a sudden upsurge in demand for people looking for rental houses.</p> <p>Thigio and Broti Towns are expected to mature and Match Gatundu and Ruiru towns in less than 5 years. According to Amcco Properties this will have a direct impact on the land prices.</p> <h3><strong>Land Prices </strong></h3> <p>Amcco Properties notes that Land prices in Ndeiya, have been on an upward surge for the last 2 years. The making of a new sub county will put more pressure in this prices. Currently plots range from 650k to 1million in <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/amcco-genesis-phase-2/">Ndeiya</a> , very soon we expect to see prices headed to 1.5m and 2.5m respectively</p> <p>Amcco Properties has several projects in this area and advises client to invest while the prices are still <a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/">Affordable</a></p> <p><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gazette-Vol.-110-13-6-22-Special-Admin-Units-.pdf">Gazette Vol. 110 13-6-22 Special (Admin Units)</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ",

Other roads connecting the Nakuru-Nairobi highway to Thogoto-Mutarakwa Road have been constructed, adding more value to land and property.</p> <p>The effect of the road network has seen developers and investors flock to the sleepy villages looking for land.</p> <p>In Ndeiya, an acre was previously sold for Sh300,000 before the construction of the roads. The moment Thogoto-Mutarakwa road was listed for construction the price rose to  Sh4 million.</p> <figure id="attachment_685" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-685" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-685" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DJI_0032-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DJI_0032-300x225.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DJI_0032-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DJI_0032-768x576.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DJI_0032-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DJI_0032-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-685" class="wp-caption-text">Thogoto-Mutarakwa road</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Touching tarmac</strong></p> <p>Upon completion of the road, the price further increased to Sh10 million per acre. Plots touching the tarmac fetch up to Sh15 million.</p> <p>Kiambu Governor James Nyoro said the county government has tarmacked about 170 kilometres of roads.</p> <p>He said the project has increased property value by up to 10 times in areas like Karai, Ndeiya and parts of Lari. He said farmers have reaped big from the road network.</p> <p>He said milk companies are now able to move around and collect milk from farmers in far-flung areas.</p> <p>Mr Peter Kague, a property expert, said a lot of money has been injected into the Kiambu economy and especially in the rural areas.</p> <p>“We have seen tremendous growth in the recent past. We have also seen subdivision of land, pooling to buy property as well as land leasing.”</p> <p>Mr Kague added that whenever tarmac touches any piece of land the price spirals upwards.</p> <p>“The moment you see a sleepy village like Ndeiya becoming a major stopover for long-distance truckers and subsequent construction of feeding joints and bungalows then that is an indicator of a fast-growing economy. The residents also need to invest in their land.”</p> <p>A real estate investor, Mr Peter Njenga, said Ndeiya has been opened up for business.</p> <p>https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/central/article/2001443026/land-prices-rise-in-kiambu-as-new-roads-bring-brisk-business</p> <p><strong>Gated community</strong></p> <p>“If there is a place that would become as expensive as areas in Kabete, Tigoni, Thindigua and Kikuyu it has to be Ndeiya,” Mr Njenga added that for the first time there is a gated community estate at Ika Ithano.</p> <p>“A small town has cropped up on Thogoto Road christened Nairobi Ndogo. These are all effects of the road network,” he said.</p> <p>Mr Njenga also noted that the number of hardware shops has tripled, an indicator of a fast-growing area with a demand for building materials. “The hardware shops dotting this place can only be seen in places like Ruiru and Membley,” he said.</p> <p>Mr John Kibunja,  who deals in building materials, said new investors buying land across Liambu have greatly improved his business.</p> <p>He noted that the newcomers putting up homes and new towns taking advantage of the roads have promoted hardware businesses.</p> <p>“We are experiencing a construction boom and it is pegged on the new roads.”</p> <p>Mr Kibunja continued: “I am able to get raw materials from big hardware shops. I buy sand and stones from Maai Mahiu and Naivasha and get back in good time.”</p> <blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ynUI6QhGLh"><p><a href="https://kenyandigest.com/land-prices-rise-in-kiambu-as-new-roads-bring-brisk-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Land prices rise in Kiambu as new roads bring brisk business</a></p></blockquote> <p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Land prices rise in Kiambu as new roads bring brisk business&#8221; &#8212; Kenyan Digest" src="https://kenyandigest.com/land-prices-rise-in-kiambu-as-new-roads-bring-brisk-business/embed/#?secret=ynUI6QhGLh" data-secret="ynUI6QhGLh" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p> ",

The formal education system nurturing doctors, lawyers, architects, entrepreneurs, creatives etc. today is as a result of <strong>Scotland Missionaries</strong> who settled in Kikuyu in 1890s. It started when the <strong>Imperial British East Africa</strong> felt that the interior of the land they were working in was ripe for evangelism. A call was sent out and within six years, missionaries landed in Mombasa from Scotland.</p> <p>Among the major sub towns in Kikuyu that is Gikambura, Thogoto, Lusigetti, Kamangu and Thigio; they chose and settled in Thogoto. Their first establishment was the <strong>Church of Scotland Mission</strong> in 1897; currently known as the <strong>Presbyterian Church of East Africa.</strong></p> <h3><strong>Kikuyu&#8217;s Role In Kenyan Education</strong></h3> <p>Thereafter, in 1901, the missionaries combined efforts and started the first boys’ boarding school with only seven students and one classroom. Later in 1920, the school had over 3000 students which then attributed to girls joining as day scholars. The school was renamed to <strong>PCEA Rev. Musa Gitau Primary School</strong> in 1975 from Thogoto Primary School.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-1916" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1828-300x200.jpg" alt="kikuyu" width="460" height="306" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1828-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1828-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1828-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1828-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1828-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" />Moving forward, the first school offering secondary school education to Africans; <strong>Alliance High School</strong> was formed in 1926.To date Alliance High School has produced Kenya’s big names i.e., Anyang’ Nyong’o ,the Governor of Kisumu County and Ngugi wa Thiong’o; East Africa’s famous Novelist.</p> <p>In 1948, Alliance Girls High School was formed to serve and nurture the girls to academic excellence as well as the boys. Both schools were started by The Alliance of Protestant Churches made up of the <strong>Anglican Church of Kenya, Methodist Church of Kenya and Church of Scotland Mission</strong> etc.<br /> As years passed, the missionaries serving the PCEA went back to their home country since the church was stable enough to run and serve its purpose. Rev Musa Gitau was appointed the first African PCEA minister and continued serving the church. It grew on and expanded all over Kenya starting with the Mt. Kenya Region.</p> <p>The church has so far sponsored educational facilities inclusive the <strong>Alliance Schools, Presbyterian University of East Africa, Thogoto Teachers’ Training College, PCEA Kikuyu Day High School and PCEA Rev Musa Gitau Girls’ Secondary School</strong>; all in Thogoto. <strong>PCEA Kikuyu Hospital</strong>; the best eye hospital in Kenya is also part of the PCEA sponsored institutions.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1915" src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1750-300x200.jpg" alt="kikuyu" width="441" height="294" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1750-300x200.jpg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1750-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1750-768x512.jpg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1750-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1750-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Aside from the church sponsored schools, there are other top-notch institutions offering reliable education inclusive;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://www.thegreengardenschools.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green Gardens Schools</a> &#8211; Gikambura</strong></li> <li><strong>Damacrest schools &#8211; Gikambura</strong></li> <li><strong>Aubrey Newmans Academy &#8211; Ruthigiti</strong></li> <li><strong>Moi Girls’ High school &#8211; Kamangu</strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Nairobi</a> (Kikuyu Campus) -Thogoto</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Kikuyu is bursting with numerous educational opportunities ranging from primary, secondary to university level.

A freehold title confers the investor with the right to use a parcel of land for an indefinite period. The investor gets a title. On the other hand, a leasehold title allows the user to use the land for a defined period. The investor is issued with a lease certificate.</li> <li>You also need to know where the land is located. This requires the investor to visit the property to ascertain the physical condition of the land. This includes the slope of the land, drainage, and proximity to social amenities.</li> <li>An investor also needs to ask about access to water and electricity. The user needs to ascertain the proximity of the land to water, electricity, and drainage systems. In particular, they need to confirm that the water available is clean for domestic use.</li> <li>Investors also need to ask why the land is being sold. Where such information is available, it can help the investor avoid getting conned. This information can be obtained from the neighbors and people residing in the area.</li> <li>It is also vital to understand who one is dealing with. Towards this end, the investor needs to understand whether they are dealing with the property agent, owner, or third parties authorized by the owner. In particular, the investor needs to know who will receive the payment on behalf of the owner.</li> <li>An investor also needs to ask whether there are any regulations for landowners in the area. This includes what they are allowed or disallowed to do. For instance, is it a controlled development area or not? If yes, the investor should ask for evidence,</li> <li>The investor also needs to ask about the accurate size of the land. This is because the land size may differ on the ground. The surest way to verify the size of the land is by searching it from the land registry.</li> <li>Another important question that a first-time investor needs to ask is whether the land has been surveyed. If the answer is affirmative, one should visit the property and look out for boundaries or land beckons. They should also countercheck the boundary with the experts in the profession, such as surveyors and attorneys, before making the purchase.<a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/green-valley-kikuyu-gikambura-plots-650k-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-424 " src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-11.09.33-2.jpeg" alt="process_of_buying_land" width="545" height="224" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-11.09.33-2.jpeg 1280w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-11.09.33-2-300x123.jpeg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-11.09.33-2-1024x421.jpeg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-13-at-11.09.33-2-768x316.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></a></li> <li>An investor also needs to ask about any additional charges related to the land. Some of these charges include land rates, security, and road improvement levies. Towards this end, the potential landowner needs to know the exact amount payable and the payment frequency.</li> </ol> <p>Lastly, a potential landowner needs to ask how they will be making the payment. If the ownership is debt-financed, the investor needs to understand the interest payable and the frequency of payments. However, if it is payable in cash, the investor needs to ask the bank account where the transfer will be made.</p> ",

This form of land ownership is common in rural areas.</span></p> <h2><strong>Freehold</strong></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most common form of private land ownership. It gives an individual or a group of people absolute claim to a piece of land for a lifetime.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In freehold land ownership, the individual can hand down land to their descendants and the person is free to use the land as they please. Notably, there are some restrictions to the use of some freehold pieces but this is not common. </span></p> <h2><strong>Leasehold</strong></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a situation where a person is given control over a piece of land to use for specific purposes as long as the person pays rent or land fees. It is common with non-Kenyans.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Leasehold is often given by local authorities for trust land, the government for public land or individuals. Government leases typically last for 99 years.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An individual who has leasehold land ownership can apply for an extension of the leasehold if they wish to continue using the land after the lease has expired.</span></p> <h2><strong>Partial ownership</strong></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a form of land ownership where an individual or group of people can get rights to use another person’s land for specific purposes.</span></p> <p><a href="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/properties/kamulu-serenity-haven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-438 " src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/process_of_buying_land.jpeg" alt="process_of_buying_land" width="352" height="264" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/process_of_buying_land.jpeg 1040w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/process_of_buying_land-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/process_of_buying_land-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/process_of_buying_land-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is often in agreement with the owner of the land. For example, communication masts placed on an individual’s piece of land fall under this form of ownership where the company which owns the mast places them on an individual’s land and partially owns that piece of land for the time in use.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you commit to buying a piece of land, it is important to ensure that you understand what form of ownership exists so that you do not fall prey to ownership that can lead to conflict.</span></p> ",

Closer home, our cultures place a premium on owning a piece of land as well as a house. While the rising cost of land has also given rise of people owning houses and apartments on shared land, the basic principle is the need to own a place to call home.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for land especially in urban areas has skyrocketed in the past couple of years, driven by the following factors;</span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">         </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land is one of the most valuable fixed assets one can own</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">         </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural-urban migration driving up demand for housing in urban areas</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">         </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government has been initiating and completing development projects in urban areas and satellite towns, which has consequently led to increased demand for land in these areas.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The constitution of Kenya holds that all citizens can own land anywhere in Kenya if they follow the legal procedures for owning land.</span></p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-458 " src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-03-25-at-20.21.11-e1616693188738.jpeg" alt="kamulu_2" width="399" height="225" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-03-25-at-20.21.11-e1616693188738.jpeg 650w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-03-25-at-20.21.11-e1616693188738-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to increased demand for land, fraudsters have taken advantage of this situation to swindle Kenyans of their hard-earned money as well as the existing gap in the knowledge on how to go about the process of owning land. The land buying process is anchored on the basic principle of the law of contract. Thus, land ownership must follow all laid down contractual and legal procedures to avoid any future conflict which can also lead to loss.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are planning to own land anywhere in Kenya, then it is important that you follow the following 10 crucial steps.</span></p> <ol> <li> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><b style="font-size: 16px;">Identify the piece of land you would like to own</b></h3> </li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before committing your money to the ownership of any piece of land, be clear on the location, soil type, and size of land you would like to own. This is based on what you plan to do with the piece of land and thus, you need to have basic things that must be met.</span></p> <ol start="2"> <li> <h3></h3> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     </span><b>Conduct a search and inspection of the identified piece of land</b></li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have identified the ideal piece of land, you should request the landowner to give you a copy of the title deed associated with the piece of land. This is what you will use to authenticate the ownership of the piece of land at the Ministry of Lands’ county headquarters office.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Ministry of Lands office at the county level, you will be required to fill a land search form and attach the copy of the land’s title deed. You will also be required to pay KSh 520 and this process can take between 2 hours and a day.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important step as this is the place where you will get to learn about any legal issues associated with the piece of land. Many people have overlooked this step and ended up losing their money in shoddy land deals. For example, there may be a caveat placed on a piece of land due to family or legal issues and this effectively means that the land cannot be transferred to any other person. </span></p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-460 " src="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-03-25-at-20.29.15-e1616693493268.jpeg" alt="plots for sale" width="495" height="278" srcset="https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-03-25-at-20.29.15-e1616693493268.jpeg 1995w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-03-25-at-20.29.15-e1616693493268-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-03-25-at-20.29.15-e1616693493268-1024x575.jpeg 1024w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-03-25-at-20.29.15-e1616693493268-768x431.jpeg 768w, https://amccopropertiesltd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-03-25-at-20.29.15-e1616693493268-1536x862.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also choose to use a registered advocate to conduct this process at a fee.</span></p> <ol start="3"> <li> <h3><b>Confirm if there are any pending land rates</b></h3> </li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land rates are taxes imposed on land by country governments and they vary from one county to another. Any pending land rates may have an impact on the cost of purchase, if the seller wishes to pass any pending costs to the buyer.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out if there are any pending land rates, visit the local country offices. Once all rates are cleared, a certificate of clearance is issued as a legal proof that there are no pending rates.</span></p> <ol start="4"> <li><b></b><br /> <h3><b>Obtain a land map</b></h3> </li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchase a land map from the local Ministry of Lands office or the local surveyor. Most people prefer getting it from the office of the local land surveyor as it is faster. It costs KSh 300.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should obtain 2 land maps. One of the land itself (drawn to scale) and another one which captures the land surrounding the piece of land you wish to purchase.</span></p> <ol start="5"> <li><b></b><br /> <h3><b>Conduct a ground verification exercise</b></h3> </li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have the 2 maps, you should visit the piece of land on the ground together with the surveyor and the seller of the piece of land. This is meant to verify the actual dimensions of the piece of land.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surveyor measures the piece of land based on the measurements on the maps and places beacons on your identified piece of land. Surveyors charge KSh 1,000 for every beacon placed. Beacons are important as they demarcate the piece of land you wish to buy and are important in forestalling any future disputes with your soon-to-be neighbors. You should also ensure that the neighbors agree on the boundaries.</span></p> <ol start="6"> <li><b></b><br /> <h3><b>Price negotiation and offer</b></h3> </li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have authenticated the real owner of the piece of land, its location as registered at the ministry of lands, the acreage of the land, and whether it has any legal issues, you can proceed to the next step if there are no issues associated with the land.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage, you will agree on the price at which you will acquire the piece of land and the seller’s advocate will then proceed to draw up an offer letter. The offer letter should capture the details of the seller and buyer, the proposed price at which the land is to be bought for, a description of the land, mode of payment, and the documents to be supplied by the seller to facilitate the land transfer process.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, the seller may request that you make a deposit of 10%. This is done through your advocate to the seller’s advocate.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that the seller’s spouse and children should be present at this stage and agree with the transaction to avoid any future disputes which may nullify any transactions made without their consent.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.  </span><b>Visit the land control board</b></h3> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The land control board is stationed at the local Ministry of Lands office and consists of village elders and an assistant county commissioner. Its main duty is to protect the seller from destroying themselves in the land-selling process, such as selling land which should not be sold or any land that has a family dispute such as one spouse selling land without the consent of the other. Thus, the board must give the final word in the sale of the land you wish to purchase.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board sits once per month and charges KSh 1,000</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A faster alternative is the Special Land Control Board (SLCB) which consists of the assistant county commissioner and the 2 parties involved in the land transaction. This board can take up to 2 hours to give consent depending on the availability of the assistant county commissioner. It charges KSh 5,000. You can make use of this board instead of waiting for the monthly meeting of the land control board.</span></p> <ol start="8"> <li><b></b><br /> <h3><b>Land transfer</b></h3> </li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are clear that the land is genuine and you have obtained the consent of the land control board, you can proceed to sign the land transfer documents, after making all the necessary payments.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To complete the land transfer process, you need to have land transfer forms signed by the seller, the consent of the land transfer board, a KRA PIN certificate, a land search form, a clearance certificate from the county council, the land sale agreement, 3 passport photos, and the old title deed. These are presented to the Ministry of Lands to facilitate the change of ownership process.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will cost you KSh 5,000 to process the new title deed and this process takes about 2 weeks.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once transfer is done, the land is now yours and you are supposed to complete any pending payment to the seller of the land.</span></p> <ol start="9"> <li><b></b><br /> <h3><b>Paying for stamp duty</b></h3> </li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the new owner, it is your responsibility to pay for the stamp duty which is based on the value of the land. Stamp duty is paid to the commissioner of domestic taxes and it is 2% of the value of the land in rural areas and 4% for land in urban areas.</span></p> <ol start="10"> <li><b></b><br /> <h3><b>After purchase</b></h3> </li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a buyer, you should confirm with the ministry of lands that the land has your correct details. This should be done after a week and if there are any issues, you can have them corrected.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land remains a precious asset in Kenya. It is your responsibility as the buyer to ensure that all legal procedures are followed to avoid any future complications with the land you buy and to secure your investment. The above 10 steps are based on the legal procedures in Kenya and are meant to protect the buyer and the seller. You can use an advocate if you are not sure of what needs to be done.</span></p> ",
